					<description><![CDATA[<p>The University of La&#160;Verne earns recognition as a 2024 ALL IN Most Engaged Campus for College Student Voting, highlighting its innovative programs, community partnerships, and on-campus voting resources.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://laverne.edu/news/2024/11/25/ulv-earns-civic-honor/">ULV Earns Civic Honor</a> appeared first on <a href="https://laverne.edu/news">University of La Verne News</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne has been named a  2024 ALL IN Most Engaged Campus for College Student Voting by the <a href="https://allinchallenge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge</a>, a distinction awarded to colleges and universities excelling in nonpartisan efforts to increase student voter participation. The university joins 471 institutions nationwide honored for commitment to civic engagement through democratic action.</p>
<p>The ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge currently supports more than 1,075 institutions representing 10.8 million students nationwide.</p>
<p>The university’s recognition reflects its success in completing ALL IN’s four key criteria: participating in the challenge, sharing its 2022 National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE) report, submitting a 2024 democratic engagement action plan, and maintaining a current signatory to the <a href="https://allinchallenge.org/presidents-commitment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Higher Education Presidents’ Commitment to Full Student Voter Participation</a>. These accomplishments were made possible through collaborative efforts by campus leaders, organizations, and dedicated students who exemplify the university’s core values of civic and community engagement.</p>
<p>“I am VERY proud of our campus community for living out our core values,” said Julissa Espinoza, director of community engagement for the Office of Civic and Community Engagement.</p>
<p>The university institutionalized its civic engagement mission through innovative initiatives. Community Engagement Day brought students together with the Office of Civic and Community Engagement’s (OCCE) partners for a day of learning, service, and action. National Voter Registration Day featured interactive opportunities for students to learn about voter registration and the importance of civic participation. A dedicated voter education table and display board ensures year-round access to resources, reinforcing voter engagement as a campus priority.</p>
<p>Programming throughout the year deepened student engagement. Events like Constitution Day, debate watch nights with discussions, and Voter Education Bingo provided dynamic spaces for democratic learning. The university also promoted local candidate debate events and our campus vote center. Social media campaigns, particularly through Instagram, amplified these efforts, reaching students where they are most active.</p>
<p>Key to these achievements were Andrew Goodman Foundation (AGF) Vote Everywhere Ambassadors Jazmin Jacamo and Matthew Markey. Their leadership played a vital role in coordinating voter registration drives and programming, supported by partnerships with campus organizations, including the College of Law and Public Service, Associated Students of ULV, the ULV Pep Band, and others.</p>
<p><span>“The research is clear: colleges and universities that make intentional efforts to increase nonpartisan democratic engagement have higher campus voter registration and voter turnout rates. This year we saw more colleges than ever before step up their efforts to ensure that their students were registered and ready to make their voices heard at the ballot box,” said </span>Jennifer Domagal-Goldman, Executive Director of the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge. <span>“These Most Engaged Campuses are setting the standard for nonpartisan civic engagement work for colleges and universities across the country.” </span></p>

<h2><span class="orange-bar">Advance Your Leadership</span></h2>
<p>Join our upoming <strong>EdD Info Webinar</strong> <strong>5:30 &#8211; 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, November 20th </strong>and discover how University of La&nbsp;Verne’s innovative online EdD program can empower you to make a lasting impact in K-12 schools!</p>
<p><a href="https://admissions.laverne.edu/register/?id=28086197-cbb8-45e8-8778-d97c2f110a67" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RSVP TODAY!  </strong></a></p>

<p>LaFetra College of Education is set to launch a fully online Doctor of Education (EdD) program in Summer 2025. Building on nearly 50 years of impact, the traditional doctorate program has produced more than 10 percent of California’s educational leaders since its inception in 1976. This new online format reflects the university’s longstanding commitment to adapting to the evolving needs of educational professionals across the state and beyond, making it easier for both current and aspiring leaders to gain the expertise required to address today’s educational challenges.</p>
<p>“By offering this fully online EdD program, we are not only expanding access to advanced leadership training, but also addressing the pressing shortage of qualified educational leaders in California and beyond,” says MD Haque, dean of LaFetra College. “Our program will prepare leaders equipped to foster change in their communities and schools.”</p>
<p>With a projected decline of 8 percent in qualified administrators by 2026, the need for effective leadership development has never been more critical. The timely initiative will help bridge the gap in shortages.</p>
<p>The online program maintains the academic rigor and real-world relevance that have defined University of La&nbsp;Verne’s EdD program since 1976. This two-year program is stackable, allowing students to build on the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential (PASC) or a master’s in educational leadership, both of which can be pursued at ULV. The program also features a “Problem of Practice” capstone project instead of a traditional dissertation. This approach empowers candidates to address specific, real-world challenges in their own schools or districts, developing practical, actionable solutions that benefit their communities immediately.</p>
<p>The fully online format is designed with the realities of today’s educational leaders in mind, many of whom work more than 60 hours per week. With more than 80 percent of school administrators experiencing increased workloads in recent years, this approach is essential. The online program enables education leaders across the country to tap into the university’s expertise without the need to relocate or scale back their professional commitments. Participants engage in comprehensive online coursework, complemented by a summer in-person intensive that promotes community-building and offers hands-on learning and networking experiences. This hybrid model merges the convenience of online education with the personal connections gained through face-to-face interactions.</p>
<p>Courses focus on essential topics in educational leadership, from culturally responsive practices and strategic planning to policy analysis and research-driven decision-making. This equips leaders with the necessary skills to tackle equity issues, advocate for effective policies, and manage diverse and dynamic educational environments.</p>
<p>Candidates will have access to mentorship, professional development, and networking opportunities. They will also have the chance to connect with the university’s extensive network of education alumni, many of whom have taken on leadership positions across California and beyond. Additionally, the program’s cohort model, a cornerstone of the EdD program&#8217;s legacy, fosters collaboration among a diverse group of peers. This creates a vibrant learning community where candidates can share experiences and perspectives. Such a collaborative approach enhances their leadership skills in PreK-12 schools, equipping them to introduce innovative and effective solutions for their communities.</p>
<p><em>Applications for the online EdD program are now open. Candidates who apply early will be considered for the program’s inaugural cohort, which begins in Summer 2025. As part of a cohort, students will engage in a supportive, collaborative learning environment, building a professional network that will benefit them throughout their careers.

<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne’s innovative  <a href="http://business.laverne.edu/dba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) </a>program has achieved national recognition, ranking third in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/business-and-marketing/best-doctorate-business-administration-programs/?form=MG0AV3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Forbes Advisor&#8217;s</em> list of the Best Online DBA Degrees of 2024</a>. This prestigious honor arrives ahead of the first cohort’s graduation this spring, marking a significant milestone for a program that only began a few years ago.</p>
<p>Led by Program Director Zhen Zhang, the three-year hybrid program combines online and on-campus instruction, making it accessible to working professionals seeking to advance their careers in upper management, consulting, research, or academia. The DBA curriculum integrates applied research with practical skills, designed to foster critical thinking, holistic problem-solving, and interdisciplinary knowledge. The program prepares students to address real-world challenges, create solutions for complex business issues, and drive organizational growth and sustainability.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a tremendous recognition for our program, especially so early on,&#8221; said <a href="https://business.laverne.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">College of Business</a> Dean Emmeline de Pillis. &#8220;We’re excited to see how our graduates will impact their fields as they step into the next phase of their careers.”</p>
<p>The DBA program offers two distinct tracks <span> — </span> a bilingual English/Mandarin cohort, offered in partnership with THH Zhidao Education for senior executives in China, and a domestic track, which recently gained F-1 visa eligibility to welcome international students. Both tracks maintain the same curriculum, though the bilingual track is taught in English and Mandarin to accommodate professionals in China.</p>
<p>Students also have the opportunity to gain practical hands-on experience through co-authored research and faculty mentorship. <span>After finishing the initial two years, students may also become eligible for a Master of Arts in Business Administration degree, enhancing career prospects.</span></p>
<p>Prospective students are encouraged to apply on a rolling basis. For more information, visit <a href="https://business.laverne.edu/dba" target="_new" rel="noopener"><span>business</span><span>.laverne</span><span>.edu</span><span>/dba</span></a>.</p>

<p>Despite facing numerous challenges, including a late asylum filing, a complex criminal history, and two interviews with the Los Angeles Asylum Office, her case was finally approved, granting her lawful status and offering a path to a new life in the U.S.</p>
<p>This success is just one of many highlights of the clinic’s work, which includes critical legal services to vulnerable immigrants, including survivors of domestic violence and victims of violent crimes. It serves 3-5 clients each semester from the Inland Empire and beyond, providing direct representation in cases involving asylum, U visas, and deportation defense. By combining hands-on legal training with community impact, the clinic empowers students to take the lead on real-life cases under the supervision of experienced faculty.</p>
<p>“Every case we win represents another step toward fairness and opportunity for those who need it most, says Krystal A. Rodriguez- Campos, associate dean of law and director of the clinic, where students work directly with clients, preparing legal documents and managing cases.</p>
<p>The clinic has experienced significant growth, expanding from a cohort of 4-6 students when it was first established in 2007 to as many as 15 per semester today, representing an increase of up to 250%. This growth reflects not only the increasing demand for legal services in the community but also the high level of student interest in gaining hands-on experience in immigration law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our students come from diverse backgrounds, but what unites them is the opportunity for real-world legal experience that they wouldn’t typically get before graduating,” said Kevin Marshall, dean of the College of Law &amp; Public Service, where the clinic is housed. “It’s incredible to see how much they contribute both to their clients&#8217; lives and the success of our law program.&#8221;</p>
<p>This recent case is part of a broader trend of growth and community impact at the clinic.</p>
<p>Many clinic alumni have gone on to build successful careers in immigration law, with two former students now working as asylum officers, another as a USCIS officer, and several others contributing to nonprofit organizations that serve immigrant communities. For instance, in an inspiring full-circle moment, alumna Monique Radziuk now serves as an asylum officer at the same office where she advocated for this client as a student.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the clinic is exploring opportunities to further expand its impact by partnering with the Santa Ana Immigration Court, where students could provide direct legal services to court litigants, further enhancing their practical experience and community outreach.</p>
<p>This experiential learning has not only shaped the careers of numerous alumni now working in immigration law but also transformed the lives of countless clients who have received life-changing legal assistance.</p>

This recognition highlights a community-centered collaboration between the university and PUSD aimed at making impactful educational resources and experiences accessible to families in the region.</p>
<p>Partnership roots stem from when Marga Madhuri, a faculty member in the Teacher Education Program, launched the Family Learning Conference in 2005. The annual event, offered at no cost to the community, initially focused on engaging families in a college campus environment with activities designed to promote literacy and lifelong learning. In 2014, Pomona formally joined the initiative thanks to the dedication of PUSD&#8217;s leadership, grant funding from the Webb Family Foundation, and the support of ULV Board of Trustee Member Emmett Terrell, PUSD&#8217;s former now retired deputy superintendent. Through the partnership, PUSD helped transform the conference into a large-scale event that brings hundreds of local families to campus each year.</p>
<p>The first year of this joint effort saw the number of participants soar from 250 to 720 when four PUSD elementary schools joined. Since then, attendance and enthusiasm have continued to grow, with over 3,000 attendees from more than ten schools participating across a decade. Children and their families have the opportunity to engage in interactive, hands-on sessions led by local authors, education program candidates, and district leaders, with offerings in Spanish to ensure accessibility for Spanish-speaking families.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with K-12 schools and districts like PUSD is a long-term commitment to elevating both teachers and leaders, driving meaningful improvements in student success and educational excellence, ” said MD Haque, dean of LaFetra College.</p>
<p>Beyond the Family Learning Conference, the university deepened its support of PUSD through the <a href="https://education.laverne.edu/dyslexia-training-professional-certificate/#:~:text=Dyslexia%20TrainingProfessional%20Certificate&amp;text=The%20University%20of%20La%20Verne,Literacy%20Education%20Council%20(IMSLEC)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dyslexia Teacher Training Program</a> launched in 2020. Created to address the critical shortage of structured literacy experts in the region, the program provides comprehensive Orton-Gillingham-based training to literacy coaches. The program has earned accreditation from the International Multisensory Structured Language Education Council (IMSLEC), establishing it as a gold standard for dyslexia intervention training in California.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2024-25 school year, all 24 literacy coaches in PUSD will complete the dyslexia rigorous curriculum and be able to provide targeted support to students in need. The program’s hands-on practicum, which takes place at Allison Elementary in Pomona, allows literacy coaches to implement strategies in real time, maximizing their training’s impact in local classrooms.</p>
<p>The award marks an exciting chapter for both institutions as they continue to elevate educational excellence across the region.</p>
<p>“LaFetra College of Education at the University of La&nbsp;Verne is proud to continue its impactful collaboration with Pomona Unified School District, supporting family learning through accessible, inclusive educational experiences,&#8221; said Shana Matamala, LaFetra assistant dean and professor. &#8220;Our partnership, built on a commitment to community enrichment and educational equity, highlights what school-university collaborations can achieve.”</p>

<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne&#8217;s Office of Civic and Community Engagement (OCCE) is making strides in supporting student involvement in democracy, a commitment recently recognized for the first time with the Silver Seal from the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge for nonpartisan voter engagement efforts in the 2022 election.</p>
<p>“We’re building a culture of civic engagement where students understand the power and responsibility of their vote,” says Julissa Espinoza, ’17, director of the OCCE. “Hosting a vote center on campus this year, alongside our other initiatives, is part of creating a community where students feel equipped and inspired to make a difference—not just on Election Day but throughout their lives.”</p>
<p>Founded over a decade ago, the OCCE has long been a cornerstone of this mission, expanding its programming to include voter registration drives, election information sessions, community service opportunities, and leadership development initiatives like the<a href="https://andrewgoodman.org/myvoteeverywhere/university-of-la-verne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Andrew Goodman Foundation ambassador program</a>. Student ambassadors serve as peer mentors, providing vital voting information and facilitating civic education events to address important social justice issues on campus. Students interested in joining this impactful program can apply in person at the OCCE office, located on the first floor of the Ludwick Center, Suite 119.</p>
<p>This year, Los Angeles County voters can cast their ballots at the Abraham Campus Center starting Saturday, November 2. For additional engagement opportunities, the OCCE encourages students to connect with the <a href="https://www.lwv.org/elections/educating-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">League of Women Voters</a>, an organization that provides resources for informed voting at local and state levels.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-14681" src="https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/JocelSanchez.jpg" alt="Jocel Sanchez" width="291" height="330" srcset="https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/JocelSanchez.jpg 500w, https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/JocelSanchez-357x405.jpg 357w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" />The university’s commitment to civic engagement is further highlighted by the <a href="https://laverne.edu/engagement/newman-civic-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campus Compact Newman Civic Fellowship</a>. Since 2013, the university has recognized community champions who demonstrate leadership in public problem-solving. Currently, anthropology major Jocel Sanchez serves as the 2024 Newman Civic Fellow. A native of the Coachella Valley, Jocel is deeply involved in her community and committed to enhancing her experiences through leadership. She was nominated for her role as president of the La&nbsp;Verne Ocean Movement, a sustainability group where she leads ocean cleanups, beautification projects, and sustainability education programs for elementary students. In November, Jocel will attend a three-day leadership conference, focusing on skill development and networking with fellow changemakers.</p>

This year’s featured book, <em>Nobody Needs to Know</em> by Pidgeon Pagonis, provides a deeply personal look into the experience of growing up intersex and the broader issues of medical ethics, challenging societal norms around gender, identity and related rights.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, October 23, 2024, Pagonis will join the campus community for two powerful discussions: a student lecture moderated by Dr. Clara Barr and a community-wide event open to the public 3-4 p.m. in Morgan Auditorium. The latter will include a book signing  in <span>Fasnacht Court, just south of the auditorium, following the discussion until 5 p.m. </span></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Nobody Needs to Know</i><span> is not </span><span>only a moving memoir; it&#8217;s also a story of how to turn personal pain into community engagement and positive social change,&#8221; says </span><span>Clara Barr, event moderator and English professor.</span></p>
<p><span>The book addresses unsettling experiences of adolescence and explores themes about alienation, identity, and self-discovery. Pagonis also discusses human rights of intersex people, and the book provides opportunities to engage in critical discussions of related topics such as LGBTQ+ issues, women’s rights, and medical rights. The book examines problems with the medical field in misdiagnosing and undermining conditions related to sexuality, with a comprehensive criticism of how authoritative systems limit individual agency and dismiss anything other than the gender binary. Pagonis recounts the activism and community engagement that led to policy changes at a local Chicago hospital regarding treatment of people born intersex.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Ultimately, the book is a celebration of the freedom and empowerment that come from learning the truth about who you are—and living it, says Josh Jensen, professor and chair of the <a href="https://artsci.laverne.edu/writing-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First-Year Rhetoric and Writing Program</a> at the university.</span></p>
<p>The initiative, rooted in the university’s commitment to lifelong learning and social responsibility, is designed to promote academic growth and civic reflection. Throughout the year, students will participate in discussions, writing exercises, and possibly service-learning projects, all inspired by the themes of annual book selections.</p>
<p>By integrating literature with the University of La&nbsp;Verne’s core values, the One Book, One University program continues to make an impact, fostering meaningful conversations that resonate beyond the classroom as well as modeling how to put theory into practice.</p>

<p>This year’s September program attracted 40 high school students eager to explore potential legal careers, including a special emphasis on municipal law. Since its inception in 2021 by BBK ’s Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Committee, Law 101 Day has become a signature DEI initiative that the University of La&nbsp;Verne is proud to support. The program aligns with the university’s mission of expanding educational opportunities, particularly for underserved communities.</p>
<p>In an exciting addition to this year&#8217;s event, five current University of La&nbsp;Verne law students took center stage, sharing their personal experiences of navigating the application process and preparing for the bar exam. Their firsthand insights provided the high school participants with a realistic glimpse into the challenges and rewards of pursuing a law degree.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-14641 alignright" src="https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/461332504_2026651451123156_4458300768702558184_n-992x748.jpg" alt="" width="352" height="266" srcset="https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/461332504_2026651451123156_4458300768702558184_n-992x748.jpg 992w, https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/461332504_2026651451123156_4458300768702558184_n-768x579.jpg 768w, https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/461332504_2026651451123156_4458300768702558184_n-405x305.jpg 405w, https://laverne.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/461332504_2026651451123156_4458300768702558184_n.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p>
<p>The students were then immersed in a practical, hands-on experience that involved tackling legal scenarios and working in teams to develop legal strategies addressing real-world issues, culminating in presentations of solutions. This exercise sharpened their legal reasoning and public speaking skills, giving them a taste of what it’s like to engage in the practice of law. Participants also had the opportunity to network with BBK attorneys, who shared their own professional journeys and offered guidance and inspiration for students considering a career in law.</p>
<p>The <span> State Bar of California accredited program at the University of La&nbsp;Verne is the only one of its kind in the region, offering a variety of  affordable and flexible pathways to pursuing a legal education, along with dual juris doctorate degree programs in public administration, business administration and educational leadership. The college is planning to launch a new bachelor of science in law and public service soon.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The University of La&#160;Verne welcomes Dr. Laura Hartley as Interim Provost.

<p>Dr. Hartley is an accomplished individual who brings a wealth of knowledge from over 25 years spent working in higher education. She graduated from Wheaton College (IL) with a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics Communication, and World Languages). Dr. Hartley then earned an MA and PhD in Linguistics with an emphasis in Sociolinguistics from Michigan State University.</p>
<p>Dr. Hartley has worked at private universities (all members of the Council of Independent Colleges) in four states. Most recently, she served as Provost/Chief Academic Officer at Seattle Pacific University (SPU) from 2020-2023. In this role, she oversaw academic affairs, student affairs, university ministries, and inclusive excellence. As the second highest-ranking officer on campus, she managed a budget of $46 million with over 300 full-time employees and staff. Her impressive work led her to serve as Executive-In-Charge of SPU after the unexpected departure of the university president.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have her join our ULV community for the next 9 months,” said Interim President Dickson. “Dr. Hartley is well positioned to carry forward the important work we’ve started to ensure that a permanent provost will be successful.”</p>
<p>Known for her collaborative and relational leadership style, Dr. Hartley has a proven track record of navigating complex administrative systems and fostering environments where people thrive.</p>
<p>Aside from her work as a university provost, Dr. Hartley served as Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and Associate Provost for Student Academic Success at George Fox University in Oregon; Associate Professor of Language and Culture and Associate Dean of the Templeton Honors College of Eastern University in Pennsylvania; and Assistant to the President for Special Projects, Grants Officer/Staff Writer in the Office of the Provost and Development Office, and Senior Instructor/Assistant Professor in the Master’s of Intercultural Relations program at Lesley University in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Over the course of her career, Dr. Hartley has made it her personal mission to create hospitable spaces where people can thrive. Her commitment to equity, inclusion, and success for students, faculty, and staff, makes her an excellent fit for the University of La&nbsp;Verne. The university is excited for Dr. Hartley to add her talents and expertise to their team of experienced executive leadership.</p>
