This would mark the 25<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecollegeexpo.org\/\">National College Resources Foundation\u2019s<\/a> Black College Expo\u2014an event dedicated to supporting Black and brown students with accessing higher education and setting them on a path to career success.<\/p>\n<p>As leaders of diversity and inclusion, the University of La&nbsp;Verne could not pass up the opportunity to participate. Amongst a sea of smaller black-and-red booths stood a titan of orange\u2014the University of La&nbsp;Verne\u2019s signature banner acted as a beacon in the middle of the convention center hall. In just a few short hours, approximately 25,000 students, family, and friends would flood the exposition room. By the end of the day, the University of La&nbsp;Verne would leave a lasting impression on everyone who attended.<\/p>\n<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne came with two objectives: admit qualified students excited at the opportunity to attend such a prestigious university, and spread the word that small schools can make a big impact, too.<\/p>\n<p>With the help of a passionate admissions team, it should come as no surprise that this event yielded results above and beyond imagination. As a title sponsor, the University of La&nbsp;Verne gifted 25,000 attendees with tote bags that bore the university\u2019s logo, as well as additional gifts like Croc shoe charms, pom-poms, lanyards, and foam finger \u201cpaws\u201d for those who came through the university\u2019s booth. University of La&nbsp;Verne President Pardis Madhavi made an appearance to meet with newly admitted students, while prospective students and their families engaged in conversations with coaches, current students, and admissions counselors to address every need and question tailored to their college experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were able to showcase the many wonderful opportunities available to students such as scholarships, internships, quality education,\u201d said Liliana Hernandez, an admissions counselor who worked the event. \u201cSeeing the smiles on a student\u2019s face after telling them they were admitted and seeing the realization that they can obtain higher education is why having a presence at this event is crucial.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The university\u2019s charm, ease of access, and top-notch academics were more than enough to win over the many students and families in attendance. So, it is no wonder that by the end of the day the University of La&nbsp;Verne community accepted hundreds of eager Leopards into the leap, and pledged to provide over $3.7 million in scholarships.<\/p>\n<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne looks forward to participating in future events in partnership with the National College Resources Foundation. Students and their families can expect to find members from the university\u2019s admissions team in Oakland on February 17, and in Atlanta on March 9, 2024.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne joined the National College Resources Foundation\u2019s Black College Expo and made a splash with prospective
