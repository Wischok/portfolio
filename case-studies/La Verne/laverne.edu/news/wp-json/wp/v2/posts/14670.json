Student ambassadors serve as peer mentors, providing vital voting information and facilitating civic education events to address important social justice issues on campus. Students interested in joining this impactful program can apply in person at the OCCE office, located on the first floor of the Ludwick Center, Suite 119.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Los Angeles County voters can cast their ballots at the Abraham Campus Center starting Saturday, November 2. For additional engagement opportunities, the OCCE encourages students to connect with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lwv.org\/elections\/educating-voters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">League of Women Voters<\/a>, an organization that provides resources for informed voting at local and state levels.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-14681\" src=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2024\/10\/JocelSanchez.jpg\" alt=\"Jocel Sanchez\" width=\"291\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2024\/10\/JocelSanchez.jpg 500w, https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2024\/10\/JocelSanchez-357x405.jpg 357w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" \/>The university\u2019s commitment to civic engagement is further highlighted by the <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/engagement\/newman-civic-fellowship\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Campus Compact Newman Civic Fellowship<\/a>. Since 2013, the university has recognized community champions who demonstrate leadership in public problem-solving. Currently, anthropology major Jocel Sanchez serves as the 2024 Newman Civic Fellow. A native of the Coachella Valley, Jocel is deeply involved in her community and committed to enhancing her experiences through leadership. She was nominated for her role as president of the La&nbsp;Verne Ocean Movement, a sustainability group where she leads ocean cleanups, beautification projects, and sustainability education programs for elementary students. In November, Jocel will attend a three-day leadership conference, focusing on skill development and networking with fellow changemakers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently
