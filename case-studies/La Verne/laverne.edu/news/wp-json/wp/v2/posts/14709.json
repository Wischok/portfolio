The university joins 471 institutions nationwide honored for commitment to civic engagement through democratic action.<\/p>\n<p>The ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge currently supports more than 1,075 institutions representing 10.8 million students nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>The university\u2019s recognition reflects its success in completing ALL IN\u2019s four key criteria: participating in the challenge, sharing its 2022 National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE) report, submitting a 2024 democratic engagement action plan, and maintaining a current signatory to the <a href=\"https:\/\/allinchallenge.org\/presidents-commitment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Higher Education Presidents\u2019 Commitment to Full Student Voter Participation<\/a>. These accomplishments were made possible through collaborative efforts by campus leaders, organizations, and dedicated students who exemplify the university\u2019s core values of civic and community engagement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am VERY proud of our campus community for living out our core values,\u201d said Julissa Espinoza, director of community engagement for the Office of Civic and Community Engagement.<\/p>\n<p>The university institutionalized its civic engagement mission through innovative initiatives. Community Engagement Day brought students together with the Office of Civic and Community Engagement\u2019s (OCCE) partners for a day of learning, service, and action. National Voter Registration Day featured interactive opportunities for students to learn about voter registration and the importance of civic participation. A dedicated voter education table and display board ensures year-round access to resources, reinforcing voter engagement as a campus priority.<\/p>\n<p>Programming throughout the year deepened student engagement. Events like Constitution Day, debate watch nights with discussions, and Voter Education Bingo provided dynamic spaces for democratic learning. The university also promoted local candidate debate events and our campus vote center. Social media campaigns, particularly through Instagram, amplified these efforts, reaching students where they are most active.<\/p>\n<p>Key to these achievements were Andrew Goodman Foundation (AGF) Vote Everywhere Ambassadors Jazmin Jacamo and Matthew Markey. Their leadership played a vital role in coordinating voter registration drives and programming, supported by partnerships with campus organizations, including the College of Law and Public Service, Associated Students of ULV, the ULV Pep Band, and others.<\/p>\n<p><span>\u201cThe research is clear: colleges and universities that make intentional efforts to increase nonpartisan democratic engagement have higher campus voter registration and voter turnout rates. This year we saw more colleges than ever before step up their efforts to ensure that their students were registered and ready to make their voices heard at the ballot box,\u201d said <\/span>Jennifer Domagal-Goldman, Executive Director of the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge. <span>\u201cThese Most Engaged Campuses are setting the standard for nonpartisan civic engagement work for colleges and universities across the country.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne earns recognition as a 2024 ALL IN Most Engaged Campus for College Student Voting, highlighting its innovative programs, community partnerships, and on-campus voting resources.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":163,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1549,4814],"tags":[2034,9692],"class_list":["post-14709","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-news-and-events","category-laverne-edu-news-university-campus-life","tag-hp","tag-office-of-civic-and-community-engagement","ulv_author-university-of-la-verne"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.8 (Yoast SEO v23.8) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>ULV Earns Civic Honor | University of La Verne<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The University of La Verne has been named a 2024 ALL IN Most Engaged Campus for College Student Voting, recognizing its leadership in nonpartisan voter participation.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/2024\/11\/25\/ulv-earns-civic-honor\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"ULV Earns Civic Honor\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The University of La Verne has been named a 2024 ALL IN Most Engaged Campus for College Student Voting, recognizing its leadership in nonpartisan voter participation.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/2024\/11\/25\/ulv-earns-civic-honor\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"University of La Verne News\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2024-11-25T18:35:37+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Jamie Ayala\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Jamie Ayala\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"2 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/2024\/11\/25\/ulv-earns-civic-honor\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/2024\/11\/25\/ulv-earns-civic-honor\/\"},\"author\":{\"name\":\"Jamie Ayala\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/#\/schema\/person\/558e80d656e059854f571f099f60bcde\"},\"headline\":\"ULV Earns Civic Honor\",\"datePublished\":\"2024-11-25T18:35:37+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2024-11-25T18:35:37+00:00\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/2024\/11\/25\/ulv-earns-civic-honor\/\"},\"wordCount\":454,\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/news\/#organization\"},\"keywords\":[\"HP\",\"Office of Civic and Community Engagement\"],\"articleSection\":[\"News and Events\",\"University &amp;
