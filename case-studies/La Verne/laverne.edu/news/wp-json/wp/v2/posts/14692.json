It serves 3-5 clients each semester from the Inland Empire and beyond, providing direct representation in cases involving asylum, U visas, and deportation defense. By combining hands-on legal training with community impact, the clinic empowers students to take the lead on real-life cases under the supervision of experienced faculty.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery case we win represents another step toward fairness and opportunity for those who need it most, says Krystal A. Rodriguez- Campos, associate dean of law and director of the clinic, where students work directly with clients, preparing legal documents and managing cases.<\/p>\n<p>The clinic has experienced significant growth, expanding from a cohort of 4-6 students when it was first established in 2007 to as many as 15 per semester today, representing an increase of up to 250%. This growth reflects not only the increasing demand for legal services in the community but also the high level of student interest in gaining hands-on experience in immigration law.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our students come from diverse backgrounds, but what unites them is the opportunity for real-world legal experience that they wouldn\u2019t typically get before graduating,\u201d said Kevin Marshall, dean of the College of Law &amp; Public Service, where the clinic is housed. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see how much they contribute both to their clients&#8217; lives and the success of our law program.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This recent case is part of a broader trend of growth and community impact at the clinic.<\/p>\n<p>Many clinic alumni have gone on to build successful careers in immigration law, with two former students now working as asylum officers, another as a USCIS officer, and several others contributing to nonprofit organizations that serve immigrant communities. For instance, in an inspiring full-circle moment, alumna Monique Radziuk now serves as an asylum officer at the same office where she advocated for this client as a student.<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, the clinic is exploring opportunities to further expand its impact by partnering with the Santa Ana Immigration Court, where students could provide direct legal services to court litigants, further enhancing their practical experience and community outreach.<\/p>\n<p>This experiential learning has not only shaped the careers of numerous alumni now working in immigration law but also transformed the lives of countless clients who have received life-changing legal assistance.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more information on the clinic and legal assistance, visit <\/em><a
