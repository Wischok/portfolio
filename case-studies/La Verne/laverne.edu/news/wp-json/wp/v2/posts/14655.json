This year\u2019s featured book, <em>Nobody Needs to Know<\/em> by Pidgeon Pagonis, provides a deeply personal look into the experience of growing up intersex and the broader issues of medical ethics, challenging societal norms around gender, identity and related rights.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, October 23, 2024, Pagonis will join the campus community for two powerful discussions: a student lecture moderated by Dr. Clara Barr and a community-wide event open to the public 3-4 p.m. in Morgan Auditorium. The latter will include a book signing\u00a0 in <span>Fasnacht Court, just south of the auditorium, following the discussion until 5 p.m. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>&#8220;Nobody Needs to Know<\/i><span> is not\u00a0<\/span><span>only a moving memoir; it&#8217;s also a story of how to turn personal pain into community engagement and positive social change,&#8221; says <\/span><span>Clara Barr, event moderator and English professor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The book addresses unsettling experiences of adolescence and explores themes about alienation, identity, and self-discovery. Pagonis also discusses human rights of intersex people, and the book provides opportunities to engage in critical discussions of related topics such as LGBTQ+ issues, women\u2019s rights, and medical rights. The book examines problems with the medical field in misdiagnosing and undermining conditions related to sexuality, with a comprehensive criticism of how authoritative systems limit individual agency and dismiss anything other than the gender binary. Pagonis recounts the activism and community engagement that led to policy changes at a local Chicago hospital regarding treatment of people born intersex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Ultimately, the book is a celebration of the freedom and empowerment that come from learning the truth about who you are\u2014and living it, says Josh Jensen, professor and chair of the <a href=\"https:\/\/artsci.laverne.edu\/writing-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">First-Year Rhetoric and Writing Program<\/a> at the university.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The initiative, rooted in the university\u2019s commitment to lifelong learning and social responsibility, is designed to promote academic growth and civic reflection. Throughout the year, students will participate in discussions, writing exercises, and possibly service-learning projects, all inspired by the themes of annual book selections.<\/p>\n<p>By integrating literature with the University of La&nbsp;Verne\u2019s core values, the One Book, One University program continues to make an impact, fostering meaningful conversations that resonate beyond the classroom as well as modeling how to put theory into practice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t miss the One Book, One University event Oct. 23 with a discussion and
