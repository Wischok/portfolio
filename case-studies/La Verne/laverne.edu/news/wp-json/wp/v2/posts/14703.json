Building on nearly 50 years of impact, the traditional doctorate program has produced more than 10 percent of California\u2019s educational leaders since its inception in 1976. This new online format reflects the university\u2019s longstanding commitment to adapting to the evolving needs of educational professionals across the state and beyond, making it easier for both current and aspiring leaders to gain the expertise required to address today\u2019s educational challenges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy offering this fully online EdD program, we are not only expanding access to advanced leadership training, but also addressing the pressing shortage of qualified educational leaders in California and beyond,\u201d says MD Haque, dean of LaFetra College. \u201cOur program will prepare leaders equipped to foster change in their communities and schools.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With a projected decline of 8 percent in qualified administrators by 2026, the need for effective leadership development has never been more critical. The timely initiative will help bridge the gap in shortages.<\/p>\n<p>The online program maintains the academic rigor and real-world relevance that have defined University of La&nbsp;Verne\u2019s EdD program since 1976. This two-year program is stackable, allowing students to build on the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential (PASC) or a master\u2019s in educational leadership, both of which can be pursued at ULV. The program also features a \u201cProblem of Practice\u201d capstone project instead of a traditional dissertation. This approach empowers candidates to address specific, real-world challenges in their own schools or districts, developing practical, actionable solutions that benefit their communities immediately.<\/p>\n<p>The fully online format is designed with the realities of today\u2019s educational leaders in mind, many of whom work more than 60 hours per week. With more than 80 percent of school administrators experiencing increased workloads in recent years, this approach is essential. The online program enables education leaders across the country to tap into the university\u2019s expertise without the need to relocate or scale back their professional commitments. Participants engage in comprehensive online coursework, complemented by a summer in-person intensive that promotes community-building and offers hands-on learning and networking experiences. This hybrid model merges the convenience of online education with the personal connections gained through face-to-face interactions.<\/p>\n<p>Courses focus on essential topics in educational leadership, from culturally responsive practices and strategic planning to policy analysis and research-driven decision-making. This equips leaders with the necessary skills to tackle equity issues, advocate for effective policies, and manage diverse and dynamic educational environments.<\/p>\n<p>Candidates will have access to mentorship, professional development, and networking opportunities. They will also have the chance to connect with the university\u2019s extensive network of education alumni, many of whom have taken on leadership positions across California and beyond.\u00a0Additionally, the program\u2019s cohort model, a cornerstone of the EdD program&#8217;s legacy, fosters collaboration among a diverse group of peers. This creates a vibrant learning community where candidates can share experiences and perspectives. Such a collaborative approach enhances their leadership skills in PreK-12 schools, equipping them to introduce innovative and effective solutions for their communities.<\/p>\n<p><em>Applications for the online EdD program are now open. Candidates who apply early will be considered for the program\u2019s inaugural cohort, which begins in Summer 2025. As part of a cohort, students will engage in a supportive, collaborative learning environment, building a professional network that will benefit them throughout their careers.
