Our regional campus at Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) offers degree completion and master\u2019s programs at both Point Mugu and Port Hueneme for active duty members and their families, civilian contractors, and civil service personnel. The result is access to relevant, real world\u2013based educational opportunities that expand skill sets and prepare for a promotion or leadership role.<\/p>\n<h2>Degree Programs<\/h2>\n<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne understands the distinct needs of active-duty military members and the challenges they encounter when trying to finish a degree while serving. NBVC offers degree completion and master\u2019s programs in a flexible environment geared toward the schedule and demands of military members and individuals working at the base.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to serving the needs of students in all military branches, the ease and availability of the University of La&nbsp;Verne\u2019s courses at the Naval Base Ventura County Military Center align with the objectives of the Navy College Program (NCP).
