This generous gift from the Fletcher Jones Foundation will make it possible for the University of La&nbsp;Verne to create an endowed professorship in artificial intelligence (AI) and grow its program in a field expected to transform global productivity.<\/p>\n<h3>The William M. Keck Foundation | $300,000<\/h3>\n<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne will create technology-intensive research immersion experiences in courses across the STEM disciplines. Research immersion experiences are effective impact practices, especially for underprepared and underrepresented groups. The University of La&nbsp;Verne is an Hispanic-serving Institution, where more than 80% of students receive some form of financial aid and many are first-generation college students. Increasing the number of CUREs in biology yielded improvements in D, F, and withdrawal rates for course modified timely completions of the senior project and retention in STEM.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ahmanson Foundation and The Sence Foundation | $49,000<\/h3>\n<p>While the rate of college students who are under-prepared in mathematics is rising, The Ahmanson Foundation and The Sence Foundation have taken the lead to financially support the University of La\u00a0Verne and its new venture of developing a math emporium. The Math Emporium concept was originally introduced at Virginia Tech in 1997, but only recently have schools began to adopt it. It allows students to check in through an electronic ID card and have access to all course materials, including textbooks, exercises, quizzes, and tests. Additionally, students have access to human and electronic assistance 24\/7.<\/p>\n<p>This new teaching tool will allow professors to develop online methods geared towards students who will be able to learn more efficiently at their own pace. The new lab and way of teaching will help decrease the drop\/fail\/withdraw rates and increase student retention.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation | $50,000<\/h3>\n<p>The University of La\u00a0Verne is invested in advancing public education, offering the local community free assessment and tutoring at its Center for Neurodiversity, Learning, and Wellness. Thanks to organizations like The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, tutoring services will be extended to Pre-K and adult-learners.<\/p>\n<h3>Southern California Edison | $15,000<\/h3>\n<p>Working to attract prospective students from diverse backgrounds and encourage them to make their academic dream to attend college a reality, the University of La\u00a0Verne offers a STEM Summer Science Camp. Designed to increase the number of these students pursuing science degrees, the camp also works to break down student confusion about the area and provide them with the support they need to succeed. This grant helps support the camp by connecting students to STEM degrees through its activities. Additional equipment was also purchased, included iPads, iClickers, and ProScopes to help make learning experiences during the camp more interactive.<\/p>\n<h2>Corporate Partners Support Important University of La&nbsp;Verne Programs<\/h2>\n<table class=\"two-column layout\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Bank of America<\/li>\n<li>Bon Appetit<\/li>\n<li>Cardenas Markets<\/li>\n<li>Cisco<\/li>\n<li>Comerica Bank<\/li>\n<li>Edison International<\/li>\n<li>Gilead<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Infoblox<\/li>\n<li>Kaiser Permanente<\/li>\n<li>Southern California Gas<\/li>\n<li>Union Bank<\/li>\n<li>US Bank<\/li>\n<li>Wells Fargo<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><strong>A series of programs continue to run as a result of corporate giving, including:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>REACH Summer Business Camp, which benefits local high-school students by providing them with an exposure to business education in a college environment and showing them ways to gain entrance and succeed in college.<\/li>\n<li>The Center for Neurodiversity, Learning, and Wellness provides a literacy program that offers tutoring services to local children and their families.<\/li>\n<li>STEM Summer Science Camp, which involves eligible high school sophomores and juniors, and is designed to increase the number of students entering the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Scholarship Support<\/h2>\n<p>The University of La\u00a0Verne Scholarship Fund is a top priority for the university and provides a foundation of support that benefits our diverse student population.
