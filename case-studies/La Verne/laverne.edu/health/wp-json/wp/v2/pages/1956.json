Monkeypox virus is in the same family of viruses as smallpox. Monkeypox symptoms are similar to smallpox symptoms, but milder, and monkeypox is rarely fatal. More than 99% of people who get this form of the disease are likely to survive. Visit the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health <a href=\"https:\/\/content.govdelivery.com\/attachments\/CALACOUNTY\/2022\/09\/23\/file_attachments\/2279070\/Monkeypox_FAQ%209.23.22.pdf\">Frequently Asked Questions<\/a> document to learn more about monkeypox.<\/p>\n<h3>How is monkeypox transmitted?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/transmission.html\">Monkeypox can spread<\/a>\u00a0primarily through direct skin to skin contact, often involving open skin. Although not a sexually transmitted disease, transmission has been taking place primarily through sexual activity. The disease can also be spread through contact with objects and surfaces as well as contact with respiratory secretions.<\/p>\n<h3>What we know about symptoms<\/h3>\n<p>Initial symptoms can include fever, chills, body aches, sore throat, headache, cough, and nasal congestion. This may eventually result in rashes \/sores in the genital and other areas including hands, feet, chest, or mouth. Some only experience a rash. For more information on signs and symptoms, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/symptoms.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Prevention<\/h2>\n<h3>How can I protect myself and prevent the spread of monkeypox?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/prevention\/protect-yourself.html\">Preventative steps<\/a>\u00a0include limiting physical encounters and skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/clinicians\/clinical-recognition.html\">looks like monkeypox<\/a>. Avoid contact with objects and materials that a person with monkeypox has used. Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially before eating or touching your face and after using the bathroom.<\/p>\n<h3>What should I do if I think I have monkeypox or I have been exposed to monkeypox?<\/h3>\n<p>The University is following LAC PH guidance on positive cases of monkeypox.\u00a0 For more information go to <a href=\"http:\/\/publichealth.lacounty.gov\/media\/monkeypox\/\">Monkeypox | LA County Department of Public Health<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals who have tested positive for monkeypox are asked to submit a report at <a href=\"https:\/\/cm.maxient.com\/reportingform.php?UnivofLaVerne&amp;layout_id=127\">University Health Report (maxient.com)<\/a>.\u00a0 \u00a0The report will be used to appropriately respond to case including cleaning, contact tracing and isolation\/quarantine guidance.<\/p>\n<p>Exposed or positive individuals should avoid close contact, including sex or being intimate with anyone, and <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/health\/\">contact Student Health Services<\/a> or their healthcare provider.<\/p>\n<h2>Vaccines<\/h2>\n<h3>Who should get the monkeypox vaccine?<\/h3>\n<p>The CDC recommends the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/poxvirus\/monkeypox\/vaccines.html\">monkeypox vaccine<\/a> for people who have been exposed to monkeypox and people who are aware that one of their sexual partners in the past two weeks has been diagnosed with monkeypox.<\/p>\n<h3>Where can I get the monkeypox vaccine?<\/h3>\n<p>Please see the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health <a href=\"http:\/\/publichealth.lacounty.gov\/media\/monkeypox\/\">guidance on monkeypox vaccine availability<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The university is closely monitoring developments with the monkeypox virus.
