In addition to electing new members, the Academy administers a series of grants to young and promising scholars at the University, and it also oversees the Faculty Lecture Series, which presents recent research by faculty. The Academy was further chartered to meet on a regular basis for members to read and critique each other&#8217;s work in progress and to hold writing seminars to assist other La&nbsp;Verne scholars in preparing their research for publication.<\/p>\n<h3>Mission<\/h3>\n<p>The La\u00a0Verne Academy will promote and facilitate research at the University of La\u00a0Verne\u00a0through publications, lectures, grants,\u00a0and\u00a0seminars.
