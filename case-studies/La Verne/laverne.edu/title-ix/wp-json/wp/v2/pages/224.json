Employees can respond in a supportive and appropriate manner by keeping the following in mind:<br><br>-If you believe that someone may be about to make a disclosure to you, inform them of your reporting obligations.<br>-Listen with empathy and avoid being judgmental or discouraging.<br>-Share relevant resources, including the Title IX webpage.<br>-Assure them that the Title IX Office is a safe space and reporting to the Title IX Office does not necessarily automatically initiate an investigation.<br>-Do not investigate the report or attempt to gather additional information yourself.<br>-Do not take any administrative or employment action without first conferring with the Title IX Coordinator.<br><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n \n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Faculty and staff play an important role in keeping the University of La&nbsp;Verne a safe and inclusive environment for learning, living, and working.
