We assist international students in navigating U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processes and maintain accurate records in the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to support compliance and manage student status.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Responsibilities of F-1 Students<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Each F-1 student is responsible for understanding and adhering to USCIS regulations. The primary purpose of holding an F1 visa is to study the United States, and students should not engage in activities that detract from this purpose.\u00a0It is crucial to review the guidelines provided on page 3 of the I-20 form. For any questions about these regulations or procedural changes, international advisors are available to assist. Updates to regulations will be communicated through the international student newsletter, by email, and our social media channels. For changes affecting student status, please contact the ISSA office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Key Responsibilities for Maintaining F-1 Status:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Maintain an Updated I-20: <\/strong><\/span><span>The I-20 is a vital document that should be kept securely with the passport. It is required for various activities such as traveling outside the U.S., applying for employment, transferring schools, and obtaining essential services like a social security card or driver\u2019s license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Full-time Enrollment:<\/strong><\/span><span>\u00a0F-1 international students must maintain full-time enrollment each semester. Undergraduate students must enroll in a minimum of 12 units per semester, while graduate students are required to take at least 9 units per semester. Graduate students must also enroll in both sessions of the semester. Only one online class per semester can be used towards full time enrollment. Additionally, international students must be registered for the required number of units at\u00a0the beginning of each semester and must maintain full-time enrollment\u00a0throughout the entire semester.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Keep Valid Passport:<\/strong><\/span><span>\u00a0The passport must have at least 6 months of validity at all times. Passport renewals can be processed through the nearest consulate of your home country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Monitor Visa Expiration:<\/strong><\/span><span>\u00a0The student visa is used for entry into the U.S. F-1 students must renew their visas outside the U.S. if it expires while studying. For travel plans, it is recommended to consult with an international advisor to avoid issues with re-entering the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Travel Documentation:<\/strong><\/span><span>\u00a0Before leaving the U.S., the I-20 form must be signed by an international advisor on page 2. Travel signatures are valid for one year and are required for travel to Canada or Mexico, regardless of the duration. <\/span><span>It the student is on OPT, travel signatures are only valid for 6 months. For travel within the U.S., it is advisable to carry the I-20, passport, and other pertinent documents; however, a visa is not required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Notify ISSA of Changes:<\/strong><\/span><span>\u00a0International students must inform the office of any of the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li><span>Failure to register for any reason, including health or financial issues<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Dropping classes that result in falling below the minimum unit requirement<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Receive an incomplete grade for a class<\/li>\n<li><span>Changing majors or graduation dates<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Completing the program<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Moving to a new address (update within 10 days and on MyLaVerne portal)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Needing to extend the program end date<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Planning to leave the U.S. for any reason<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Planning to transfer to another institution<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span><strong>Employment Opportunities<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span>F-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year but may accept on-campus employment under certain conditions and restrictions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span><strong>On-Campus Employment:<\/strong><\/span><span>\u00a0Eligible international students may work on campus up to 20 hours per week during the academic term and up to 28 hours per week during vacations or breaks.
