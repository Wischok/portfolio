Currently SHARE offers two categories of special communities\u2013 \u201cLiving Learning\u201d communities and \u201cExperience\u201d communities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cExperience\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0communities are communities made of a group of individuals who have a particular experience in common (i.e. women, first year students, graduate students, non-traditional students). The programming and activities in these communities are mindful of the specific designation and aim to be relevant to the particular group. Students also benefit from being in an environment primarily composed of individuals who share this commonality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cLiving Learning\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0communities are communities that in addition to having a group of people with a shared experience and identity also have a built in academic component. More specifically, students of the shared experience not only live together but take classes together. These communities are important as they link the academic experience with the co-curricular experience and thus allow students to maximize their collegiate experience.<\/p>\n<p>Specific communities currently offered at the University of La&nbsp;Verne include:<\/p>\n<h3>First Year Experience Communities<\/h3>\n<p>The focus of the First Year Experience Communities is to provide a community-oriented environment where first year students can learn about the university, get involved, make friends and succeed academically! The residence life staff collaborates with residents to develop individual relationships and programs that ultimately help students get to know each other and get the most out of their college experience.<\/p>\n<p>Only new first-time freshmen will be eligible to live in these halls. Students who meet the criteria and are interested in this community will be able to select these halls when choosing rooms via the Electronic Housing Application.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe First Year Experience Hall is the place where students begin to form their La&nbsp;Verne family.
