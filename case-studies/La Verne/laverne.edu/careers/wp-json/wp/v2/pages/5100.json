Graduates are asked about their employment plans, career fields, job location, employers, salary and other plans such as graduate or professional education.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long will it take to complete the survey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The First Destination Survey is a very brief (five to seven-minute) online survey that the University of La&nbsp;Verne graduating students take approximately four weeks prior to their graduation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How will this information be used?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With the information you share, we will work to enhance services provided to all University of La Vern alumni as well as current and future Leos to help you reach your career and post-graduation goals. Summary reports of the results are also used for accreditation and federal and state compliance. This ensures the future value and integrity of your degree.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is the survey completely anonymous?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. Identifying information is stored along with the responses for the purpose of matching demographic data so that we can accurately report on the outcomes of various student groups and also to see areas where we may need to improve as an institution. Access to match the records to individuals is restricted to 2 individuals inside the University Career Center. All data reported externally is shared as aggregate numbers, either as counts or averages. Individual student responses are provided to academic departments and colleges upon request, but identifying information is not provided.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do I know if my survey was submitted?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Upon completing the survey you will receive an email notification to your @laverne.edu email.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where can I find further information on this topic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For any further questions please email the Career Center at ca&#114;eerc&#101;&#110;t&#101;r&#64;&#108;&#97;&#118;e&#114;n&#101;&#46;e&#100;u with your name and student ID along with a summary of your question\/issue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you embark on this exciting new chapter in your life, we would like to hear about the path you have chosen to take after graduating from the University of La&nbsp;Verne.
