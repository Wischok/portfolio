This track is designed for students planning administrative careers in early childhood education in public or private schools, and\/or social service agencies. BS coursework focuses on studies of the growth and development of children, as well as administrative requirements in relation to the family, school, and community. MS coursework focuses on brain development, cognition, attachment, and research in Child Development. The Integrated BS + MS requires a 3.0 GPA (maintained throughout the program) a writing assessment, and a face-to-face interview with the program chair. Semester advising appointments are required throughout the first four years to monitor GPA and portfolio requirements. Students who do not progress according to the requirements of the accelerated program may be counseled into the traditional Child Development BS program. Upon successful completion of the third year of the Child Development Integrated BS + MS, students will interview with the Chair of the Child Development MS Program for authorization to advance to prerequisites for the MS portion of the program. Advancement will be determined by an interview, writing sample, current GPA, and recommendation from the BS program chair. All Child Development BS + MS students must obtain cleared fingerprints (Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Child Abuse Index) through the Fairplex Child Development Center. A record of current immunizations must be on file. Be advised it is recommended students declare themselves as a Child Development major by the end of their freshman year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","degree_level":[48,53],"location":[62],"department":[1100,1099,489],"college":[13],"experience":[950],"program_tag":[],"class_list":["post-1781","academic_program","type-academic_program","status-publish","hentry","degree_level-bachelors-tug","degree_level-masters","location-laverne","department-child-adolescent-development-ms","department-child-development-bs","department-lafetra-college-of-education","college-lfce","experience-in-person"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.8 (Yoast SEO v23.8) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Child Development - Integrated BS+MS | The University of La Verne<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The Child Development Integrated B.S.+M.S. program is designed as an accelerated four-year B.S. plus one year M.S. program at La Verne.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/programs\/child-development-integrated-bs-ms\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Child Development - Integrated BS+MS\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The Child Development Integrated B.S.+M.S. program is designed as an accelerated four-year B.S. plus one year M.S. program at La Verne.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/programs\/child-development-integrated-bs-ms\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"The University of La Verne\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ULaVerne\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2021-11-19T18:38:34+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@ULaVerne\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"1 minute\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/programs\/child-development-integrated-bs-ms\/\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/programs\/child-development-integrated-bs-ms\/\",\"name\":\"Child Development - Integrated BS+MS | The University of La Verne\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2018-07-09T23:33:03+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2021-11-19T18:38:34+00:00\",\"description\":\"The Child Development Integrated B.S.+M.S. program is designed as an accelerated four-year B.S. plus one year M.S. program at La Verne.\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/programs\/child-development-integrated-bs-ms\/#breadcrumb\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/programs\/child-development-integrated-bs-ms\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/programs\/child-development-integrated-bs-ms\/#breadcrumb\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Child Development &#8211;
