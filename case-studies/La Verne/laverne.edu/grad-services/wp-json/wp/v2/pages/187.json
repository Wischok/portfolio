This implies that graduate students must perform at an above-average level, compared to undergraduate standards, in order to progress satisfactorily in graduate programs. It also implies that the C- and D grades are unacceptable in graduate work; therefore, there are no C- or D grades for graduate students.<\/p>\n<p>A&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.4.0 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nA- &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..3.7 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nDemonstrates insightful mastery of the subject matter and exceptional quality in written and oral communication.<\/p>\n<p>B+ &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.3.3 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nB&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.3.0 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nB- &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..2.7 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nExhibits professional competence in the subject matter and in all written and oral communication.<\/p>\n<p>C+ &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.2.3 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nC &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;2.0 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nCompletes course assignments and requirements with minimally acceptable proficiency in written and oral communication.<\/p>\n<p>F&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.0 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nQuality and quantity of work in and out of class are unacceptable.<\/p>\n<p>WF &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;0 quality points per semester hour.<br \/>\nDesignates an unofficial withdrawal from a course.

Certain courses designated CRD\/NCR only\u201d in the Courses section of this catalog, may only be taken CRD\/NCR.<\/p>\n<p>Graduate students must take challenge exams and competency exams CRD\/NCR, but they must register for a letter grade in every other course if they are in a credential or degree program unless the course is offered \u201cCRD\/NCR only.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Incomplete Grades (INC)<\/h3>\n<p>Incompletes are authorized only when it is impossible for the student to complete the course because of illness or other justifiable cause and has successfully completed all work up to the last day to withdraw. The student must initiate a request for an incomplete, and, if able, complete a formal petition available on the La&nbsp;Verne Portal.\u00a0 The request for Incomplete can be found on the Student Record Menu. By completing the contract, the student agrees to complete the work specified in the contract. The completed contract must be filed prior to the last day of the term. The faculty member will review the contract at the time of grading and can reject or amend it. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to check his or her La&nbsp;Verne Portal account to view the status of the incomplete contract.<\/p>\n<p>Students who receive an INC in Fall Term must complete their courses by the end of Winter Term.\u00a0 Students who receive an INC in Fall Semester, January Interterm, or Winter Term must complete their courses by the end of Spring Term. Students who receive an INC in Spring Semester, Spring Term, or any Summer Term must complete their courses by the end of Fall Term. The instructor has the option of requiring an earlier deadline by specifying it in the Incomplete Contract. INC grades not completed by the appropriate deadline will become NCR or F grades depending on the grading option for the course.<\/p>\n<h3>In Progress Grades (IP)<\/h3>\n<p>In Progress grades are reserved for those directed studies, independent studies, field work courses, senior projects, and graduate culminating activities where the contract at the time of registration specifies a date of completion that is beyond the end of the term of registration. The intent of the IP policy is to provide for individualized study which, in its inception, requires more than the normal term or semester to complete. Students who receive IP grades are considered to be maintaining satisfactory academic progress for financial aid purposes. An IP grade will become an NCR or F, depending upon the grade option, if not cleared within one year following the term of registration.<\/p>\n<h3>No Grade (NG)<\/h3>\n<p>This is a temporary grade issued by the Registrar pending receipt of the official grade from the instructor.\u00a0 NG grades issued in Fall Term will become NCR or F grades, depending upon the grade option, unless the instructor submits an official grade by the end of Winter Term. Similarly, NG grades issued in Fall Semester, January Interterm, or Winter Term will become NCR or F grades unless the instructor submits an official grade by the end of Spring Term, and NG grades issued in Spring Semester, Spring Term, or any Summer Term will become NCR or F grades unless the instructor submits an official grade by the end of Fall Term.<\/p>\n<h3>Final Grades<\/h3>\n<p>Grades submitted to the Registrar by the instructor of record are final and official. By policy a final grade is based on the instructor\u2019s evaluation of course work completed as of the contractual end of the course. Final grades may not be changed as the result of the submission of additional work or the repeating of examinations after the contractual conclusion of the course for the purpose of improving the final grade. The Registrar is authorized to accept an adjusted grade only when all of the following conditions are met:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The student applies to the instructor for a re-evaluation within four weeks after the student grade is available through La&nbsp;Verne Portal;<\/li>\n<li>The instructor concludes by re-evaluation that the original grade issued was in error based on the work completed at the time that the original grade was issued; and<\/li>\n<li>The revised grade is officially reported by the instructor to the Registrar as a result of reevaluation within a reasonable time after the grade report was made available on La&nbsp;Verne Portal.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A student may elect to repeat a La&nbsp;Verne course for the purpose of improving a grade if repeated at La&nbsp;Verne. The student must enroll in the same La&nbsp;Verne course and is expected to repeat it in its entirety. When a course is repeated, the original course, grade, and semester hours remain on the transcript, but are appropriately marked and are no longer part of the student\u2019s GPA or applicable toward credit for graduation. Only the grade and semester hours of the repeated course are counted.<\/p>\n<p>Notification of final grades for each course is made through each student\u2019s La&nbsp;Verne Portal account. A student who has a hold on his or her account must clear the hold to view final grades.<\/p>\n<h3>Appeals of Final Grades<\/h3>\n<p>A student who feels that an incorrect grade has been given must consult with the instructor first and must make this appeal within four weeks after grades are issued. A student dissatisfied with the instructor\u2019s response may appeal to the program chair and department chair. Subsequently, an appeal may be made to the appropriate college Dean and finally to the Provost. Questions of subject matter will usually be handled by the department. Charges of injustice due to prejudice or capricious action may require the attention of the Dean.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Graduate Grading Policy The grading policy for graduate students is based on the assumption that the grade for acceptable and satisfactory performance in graduate study is B (3.0).
