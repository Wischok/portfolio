Also see &#8220;Military Refund Policy&#8221; section below.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Leaves of Absence<\/h2>\n<p>If you are a traditional undergraduate student or graduate student attending the Main Campus and find it necessary to interrupt your studies at the University of La&nbsp;Verne due to deployment, contact the Office of the Registrar to apply for a leave of absence prior to leaving the University. The leave of absence form requires signatures from the Office of Student Accounts, an officer from Financial Aid, and the Office of Academic Advising.<\/p>\n<p>With a leave of absence, an undergraduate student may be absent from La&nbsp;Verne for up to two semesters and a graduate student may be absent from La&nbsp;Verne for up to four semesters without reapplying for admission. Among the acceptable reasons for granting a leave of absence are military duties and financial or medical problems. Students are required to keep the University informed about plans for return; otherwise, they will be considered withdrawn.<\/p>\n<p>If your deployment keeps you away from your studies for longer than the periods noted above, you may either apply for readmission (pg. 16 of the catalog) upon your return, or you may submit an academic appeal to continue your degree program under the original catalog requirements to which you were admitted. This option is only available to those students who applied for graduation prior to taking a leave of absence. For students submitting academic appeals as a result of military deployment, the appeals fee is typically waived.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you attend La&nbsp;Verne through one of the Regional Campuses or the Online program<\/strong>, you have seven years from the term of your admission to complete your degree as an undergraduate student, or five years as a graduate student. You do not need to submit a formal leave of absence if you need to interrupt your studies due to deployment or other military duties. You do, however, need to follow the Drop and Withdrawal procedures (pg. 41-42 of the catalog).<\/p>\n<h2>Military Connected Appeal to Policy Exceptions<\/h2>\n<p>Active-Duty students who miss the drop or withdraw deadlines, who must take an extended period of absence from school due to a Deployment, PCS, TDY or unavoidable duty assignment<br \/>\nimposed by military obligation, may Appeal for retroactive application and or reinstatement. In agreement with the DoD and Veterans Administration, certain Appeals can be made with<br \/>\nexception, regardless of the <a href=\"https:\/\/catalog.laverne.edu\/academic-information\/#registrationinformationtext\">published timeline<\/a>. Military Connected students should connect with their academic advisor before initiating an Appeal for Extension of Time, Late drop or<br \/>\nwithdraw. Full policy details can be viewed under &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/catalog.laverne.edu\/rights-responsibilities\/#studentresponsibilitiestext\"> Academic Policy Exceptions<\/a> &#8216; in the University catalog.<\/p>\n<h2>Military Refund Policy<\/h2>\n<p>A full refund of tuition and mandatory fees will be authorized for students who are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Military reservists who receive orders to active duty after having enrolled and paid for tuition and fees.<\/li>\n<li>Active duty military personnel who receive a reassignment after having enrolled and paid for tuition and fees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is the student\u2019s responsibility to officially notify the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Student Accounts, if he or she receives orders for deployment or reassignment. Students enrolled in courses at the time they are called for military service will need to provide a copy of the official document(s) stating the orders of military service and dates. If the student is deployed during the add\/drop period, the student will need to drop their classes through MyLaVerne. If the student is deployed after the add\/drop period the student can request an administrative drop and the following will take place:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tuition and Fees will be reversed<\/li>\n<li>Financial Aid will be adjusted according to institutional, local, state and federal refund policies<\/li>\n<li>Student refunds generated and received as a result of financial aid may be required to be repaid by the student<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the event that there is an unpaid student account balance at time of or after deployment, the university will work with the student on payment arrangements. No collection actions will occur during deployment; however, the student must resolve any unpaid balances upon return and prior to subsequent enrollment.<\/p>\n<h2>Military Connected Student Support<\/h2>\n<p>The Office of the Registrar, Financial Aid, Student Accounts and <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/veterans\/\">Abraham Veteran Students Success Center<\/a> have staff and resources to assist active military, veteran and military connected students through admission, registration, DOD\/VA and financial aid benefits, and financial arrangements.
