The university\u2019s educational experience offers close student-faculty interactions. Virtually every undergraduate student is involved in a student thesis project that involves one-on-one mentoring by a faculty member. The January interterm also provides a focused learning experience in small groups, allowing for individualized attention, in-depth scholarship, and service learning as well as opportunities for field study and international travel. The faculty prides itself on its ability to work with a diverse student population and to help them develop to their full potential.<\/p>\n<p>La\u00a0Verne\u2019s approach to scholarship and education is best captured by the phrase \u201ctheory and practice.\u201d We believe that a university can play a transformative role by bridging the gap between the abstract role of academic theory and the world of practical problems. Our faculty brings an academic perspective to these real world problems and integrates it into both research and teaching.<\/p>\n<p>The university recognizes the value of strongly promoting faculty research, scholarly, artistic, and professional activities to enhance both the educational experience and the academic reputation of the institution. The <a href=\"https:\/\/myportal.laverne.edu\/web\/orsp\">Office of Research and Sponsored Programs<\/a> has been created to identify external funding opportunities and to assist faculty in grant preparation and administration. This office will work closely with Foundations Relations in the University Advancement to match faculty research interests with funding opportunities. To emphasize and celebrate La\u00a0Verne\u2019s scholarship, the faculty have created the \u201cLa\u00a0Verne Academy\u201d whose members select an additional new member each year. Membership is based on the faculty member\u2019s contribution to their academic discipline, recognition beyond the university, and support of research at here at the university.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>La\u00a0Verne\u2019s faculty is made up of some 200 scholar-teachers that focus on creating a learning community that puts the student first.
