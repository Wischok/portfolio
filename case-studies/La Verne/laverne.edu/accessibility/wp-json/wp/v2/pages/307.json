The tasks performed by the dog must be directly related to the person\u2019s disability. In some cases, a miniature horse may also qualify as a service animal.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-content-wrapper\">\n<h3 class=\"collapsible-header\">Service Animals on Campus<\/h3>\n<div id=\"collapsible-content-1725551434698\" class=\"collapsible-content\">\n<p>Though the presence of a service animal is a legal right and not an accommodation that needs approval, we highly encourage students with service animals to notify Accessibility Services about their service animal. This allows us to assist in navigating the campus, coordinate with other offices as needed, and advocate for the student. Faculty and staff are encouraged to refer a student with a service animal to our office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It is essential to coordinate with Accessibility Services when a student with a service animal plans to participate in a lab or live in university housing.\u00a0 We will work with the student and relevant\u00a0 faculty and\/or staff to ensure the safe and appropriate integration of the service animal in these spaces. Accessibility Services will confirm this coordination with a Service Animal Notification letter.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-content-wrapper\">\n<h3 class=\"collapsible-header\">Permitted Questions<\/h3>\n<div id=\"collapsible-content-1725551455315\" class=\"collapsible-content\">\n<p>Faculty and staff may only ask two questions <strong>if it is not immediately apparent<\/strong> that the animal is a service animal:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability?<\/li>\n<li>What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If Accessibility Services has issued a Service Animal Notification letter, these questions have already been addressed and should not be asked again.<\/p>\n<p>Faculty and staff <strong>should refrain<\/strong> from asking students about their disability or requesting documentation or proof that the animal is a service animal. It\u2019s important to respect the privacy and rights of individuals with service animals, as these questions are neither necessary nor appropriate.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-content-wrapper\">\n<h3 class=\"collapsible-header\">Service Animal Etiquette<\/h3>\n<div id=\"collapsible-content-1725551472426\" class=\"collapsible-content\">\n<p><strong>Do Not Distract<\/strong><br \/>\nService animals are working animals, and their focus is crucial. Please do not pet, feed, or distract a service animal. Always speak to the handler, not the animal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect Personal Space<\/strong><br \/>\nAvoid touching or interacting with a service animal without the handler\u2019s explicit permission. Always address the handler first and respect their space and working relationship.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maintain Professionalism<\/strong><br \/>\nTreat students with service animals with the same respect as any other individual. Do not make assumptions about the handler\u2019s disability or the reason for the service animal. The handler and the service animal work as a team, and it\u2019s important to maintain professionalism in all interactions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do Not Offer Food to a Service Dog<\/strong><br \/>\nOffering food to a service dog is a major distraction and could disrupt the dog\u2019s duties. Service dogs often follow strict diets and schedules, so it\u2019s important not to interfere with their routine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Treat the Handler with Sensitivity and Respect<\/strong><br \/>\nAsking personal questions about the handler\u2019s disability is intrusive and disrespectful. Assume the service dog team can manage independently. If you sense they might need help, ask first and respect their decision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Napping Service Dogs Are Still On Duty<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s natural for service dogs to nap when their handler is stationary for a while. Even while resting, the service dog is still on duty, so all etiquette guidelines remain in place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inform the Handler if the Dog Approaches You<\/strong><br \/>\nIf a service dog comes toward you, inform the handler without interacting with the dog. The handler will manage the situation appropriately.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-content-wrapper\">\n<h3 class=\"collapsible-header\">Frequently Asked Questions<\/h3>\n<div id=\"collapsible-content-1725551515760\" class=\"collapsible-content\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What is the difference between an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) and a service animal?<\/strong><br \/>\nA service animal is specifically trained to perform tasks or work for a person with a disability, such as guiding a person who is blind or alerting a person who is deaf. Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) provide comfort and emotional support but are not trained to perform specific tasks related to a disability. ESAs are not granted the same access rights as service animals and are typically not allowed in public places where pets are not permitted, including most areas on campus.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Do service animals need to wear identification or a vest?<\/strong><br \/>\nNo, service animals are not required by law to wear identification, such as a vest or tag. While some handlers choose to have their service animals wear identification, it is not mandatory. The absence of a vest does not diminish the service animal&#8217;s role or the handler&#8217;s rights.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What should be done when a service animal is present in class with another student who is allergic or scared of dogs?<\/strong><br \/>\nIf a service animal is in class and another student has a fear of or allergy to dogs, it\u2019s important for the concerned student to communicate this to Accessibility Services as soon as possible. Accessibility Services will work with all parties to explore reasonable modifications and\/or possible accommodations. However, it\u2019s essential to understand that the student with a service animal has a legal right to have their service animal present in class. The service animal cannot be denied access to the class while waiting to confirm if anyone is allergic or scared. Accommodations for all students can be made, but the service animal must remain in the classroom.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What happens if there\u2019s a medical emergency involving a student with a service animal?<\/strong><br \/>\nIn the event of a medical emergency, treat the situation as you would any other emergency, contacting 911 and Campus Safety. Emergency personnel are trained to respond to situations involving service animals. The service animal is trained to remain calm during emergencies, but if needed, emergency responders will know how to manage the situation, including temporarily handling the service animal if necessary. Faculty and staff should instruct other students in attendance to remain calm, follow any given instructions, and give the student and service animal space to ensure the situation is handled safely and effectively.<\/li>\n<li><strong>When is it appropriate to remove a service animal from a classroom or campus?<\/strong><br \/>\nA service animal can be removed from a classroom or campus if it poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others that cannot be mitigated through reasonable modifications or possible accommodations. Additionally, a service animal may be removed if it is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, or if the animal is not housebroken. Disruptive behavior, such as repeated barking or aggression, are examples of situations where removal may be appropriate. If a service animal is removed, the student with the disability should be given the opportunity to continue participating in the class without the service animal, potentially with other accommodations provided<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Overview Service animals play a crucial role in providing access and independence for individuals with disabilities.
