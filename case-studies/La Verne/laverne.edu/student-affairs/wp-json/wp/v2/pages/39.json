La&nbsp;Verne is dedicated to the success of its students by providing diverse programs, services, and facilities designed to enhance student life, create a positive campus community, and facilitate opportunities for involvement that enhance the educational mission of the institution.<\/p>\n<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne is aimed at improving the quality of education. The success of this institution is determined by how well La&nbsp;Verne is fulfilling its mission and how well students and faculty develop a teaching and learning partnership. The Division of Student Affairs has begun to identify learning outcomes with specific program areas in an effort to enhance the educational mission of the University of La&nbsp;Verne and align, what has typically been viewed as &#8220;non-academic&#8221; areas with academic programs and support services.<\/p>\n<p>A quality assessment program answers three essential questions:<\/p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>What are we attempting to do?<\/li>\n<li>How well are we doing it?<\/li>\n<li>How-using these answers-can we improve what we are doing?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Recent research has provided evidence that the out-of-class environment is an important factor in learning student development, academic achievement, and retention. In the publication, Learning Reconsidered: A Campus-wide Focus on the Student Experience, (2004) by the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) and American College Personnel Association (ACPA), learning is defined &#8220;as a comprehensive, holistic, transformative activity&#8221; integrating academic learning and student development, processes that have often been considered separate and independent of each other, across the college experience. The Division of Student Affairs at the University of La&nbsp;Verne could not agree more.<\/p>\n<p>We are excited about the journey ahead and see many opportunities for collaboration, growth and program enhancement within all of our areas. We want to continue making a difference in the lives of our students, and hope that through our assessment, we can further foster student development in positively meaningful ways at the University of La&nbsp;Verne.<\/p>\n<h2>Explore the Program<\/h2>\n<table class=\"table article-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-affairs\/assessment\/faqs\/\">Frequently Asked Questions<\/a><\/td>\n<td>Learn about the assessment process and its outcomes.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-affairs\/assessment\/research\/\">What&#8217;s New in Student Affairs Research?<\/a><\/td>\n<td>Off-site research links for student affairs professionals.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-affairs\/assessment\/resources\/\">Assessment Resources<\/a><\/td>\n<td>Links to university and web resources about assessment.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-affairs\/assessment\/planning-characteristics\/\">Assessment Planning Characteristics<\/a><\/td>\n<td>Read about how the University of La&nbsp;Verne Office of Student Affairs approaches its assessment.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-affairs\/assessment\/report-requirements\/\">End of the Year Report Requirements<\/a><\/td>\n<td>Format of Departmental End-of-Year Report is based on the individual style (prose, bullets, etc.) of the director.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-affairs\/assessment\/links\/\">Assessment Links<\/a><\/td>\n<td>Additional assessment links, tools, and instruments.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-affairs\/assessment\/contact\/\">Contact Information<\/a><\/td>\n<td>Phone and email contact information for the various departments that fall under the Office of Student Affairs.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear La&nbsp;Verne Campus Community: The Division of Student Affairs at the University of La&nbsp;Verne is making a difference in the lives of our students.
