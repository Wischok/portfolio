One of the strengths of our system is the diversity of its members. Each chapter, no matter how large or small, includes members of varied backgrounds, ethnicities, and interests.<\/p>\n<p>With many opportunities for leadership, community service, academic excellence and social events, joining a fraternity or sorority will provide life-long friendships and excellent opportunities for personal growth.<\/p>\n<h2>Scholarship and Academics<\/h2>\n<p>The university\u2019s FSL community values high scholarship and academic excellence. La&nbsp;Verne Greeks pride themselves on maintaining GPAs consistently above their non-Greek peers and provide scholastic assistance through tutoring and group study sessions to help members maintain academic eligibility requirements for membership.<\/p>\n<h2>Community Service &amp; Philanthropy<\/h2>\n<p>Community service is one of the founding principles of all fraternities and sororities. No matter what your service interests may be, you\u2019ll find ways to be a part of both \u201chands-on\u201d service and fundraising as part of the FSL community. Events range from beach cleanups, making care packages for those in need, donation collections, and so much more.<\/p>\n<h2>Leadership<\/h2>\n<p>Because Greek organizations self-govern, they provide a wealth of initiatives for their members. Whether serving on a committee, holding an officer position, or participating in the Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, College Panhellenic Association, or the Order of Omega, there are many ways to explore and strengthen leadership skills and enhance your professional development.<\/p>\n<h2>Community (Brotherhood\/Sisterhood)<\/h2>\n<p>Breaks from the demands of the classroom are important, too. Throughout the year, fraternities and sororities sponsor social events, all-Greek mixers, cookouts, and formals. These events allow fraternity and sorority members to spend time with their chapters and create life-long bonds with their fellow Greeks.<\/p>\n<h2>The Order of Omega Honors Society<\/h2>\n<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne inaugurated its Upsilon Kappa chapter of The Order of Omega in 2005. This venerable organization recognizes leaders throughout our FSL community with exceptionally high standards of scholarship, leadership and involvement within their organization, Greek Life, the ULV community, and local community. The Order of Omega works together \u2014 and with faculty and alumni \u2014 to help guide local and intercollegiate Greek affairs. Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors can apply during the fall or spring semester.<\/p>\n<h2>Get Involved<\/h2>\n<p>Attend informal sessions for the organization(s) that interest you and speak with current members to learn more.
