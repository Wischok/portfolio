The policies that have been established for the evaluations process are specified in the Course Catalog. Exceptions to these policies are rare and approved only at the discretion of the Registrar and the Undergraduate Appeals Committee. The ultimate responsibility for establishing policies and regulations for transcript evaluation rests with the Faculty and the <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/provost\">Provost<\/a>. The Provost is responsible for assuring that the faculty\u2019s directives are developed and implemented, as well as for maintaining academic quality and fairness.<\/p>\n<p>To assure consistency and fidelity to university policy, the <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/registrar\">Office of the Registrar<\/a> is responsible for performing official evaluations of all transcripts for all undergraduates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transcripts of coursework completed prior to admission that are not submitted before an admission decision is made will not be considered for transfer credit after admission has been granted. <\/strong>The Office of Admission requires a full and complete academic history to administer an admission decision. Failure to disclose all previous institutions you&#8217;ve attended can result in revocation of your admission. The University of La&nbsp;Verne reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant who fails to completely and accurately disclose all colleges and universities previously attended. Failure to do so, may be interpreted as falsification of documentation. Any applicant who is found to submit altered, forged, or falsified documentation to the university may be denied admission or have any offer of admission already made revoked, and no further applications will be considered. Findings of falsified admission information may also be used to justify disqualification or termination of enrollment for a current student, including revocation of course credit, grades, and degree.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All coursework completed at any non-ULV institution post-matriculation must be submitted within 45 calendar days of the end of the full term\/semester where the coursework was completed. Students who do not submit transcripts within the 45 days will need to appeal. <\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>General Transfer Credit Policies<strong><u><br \/>\n<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Only credit from an institution accredited by an agency recognized by the University of La\u00a0Verne is evaluated for transferability. <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/accrediting-organizations\/\">Click \u00adhere<\/a>\u00a0for a list of approved accrediting agencies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Credit is awarded for baccalaureate level courses only.<\/strong>\u00a0Courses not designated as baccalaureate level by the credit granting institution are not transferable. College preparatory and high school level courses are not transferable.<\/li>\n<li>A minimum grade of C- must be earned in each course.<\/li>\n<li>A maximum of 88 semester hours of college credit will be applied toward the bachelor\u2019s degree. Any transfer work completed after matriculation and beyond the 88 semester hour limit will be considered for subject area fulfillment, but will not transfer with unit value (the particular course will be fulfilled by a 0-unit course marker).<\/li>\n<li>Coursework may not duplicate or overlap with other courses.<\/li>\n<li>Courses deemed to be CSU or UC transferable will be awarded credit towards a bachelor\u2019s degree.

In order to be considered for transfer, the courses must be considered degree applicable at the credit-granting institution. Professional growth or graduate level coursework will not be considered for transfer credit. If the extension courses are identified as upper division by the credit-granting institution, a maximum of 8 semester hours may be applied toward the upper division requirement.<\/li>\n<li>A maximum of 44 semester hours of baccalaureate-level vocational work will be accepted for the Bachelor degree.<\/li>\n<li>A maximum of 21 semester hours of baccalaureate-level vocational work will be accepted for the Associate degree.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Application of Transfer Credit<\/h2>\n<p>Credit may be transferred from accredited community colleges, four-year colleges and universities.\u00a0<em>Students may transfer a combined maximum of 88 semester hours for credit towards the Bachelor\u2019s degree.<\/em>\u00a0Courses eligible for transfer credit include any courses designated as baccalaureate level by the credit granting institution.
