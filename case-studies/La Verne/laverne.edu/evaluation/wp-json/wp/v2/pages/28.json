The University of La&nbsp;Verne follows the credit recommendations set forth by the American Council on Education (ACE) for minimum passing score requirements. Transfer credit for CLEP and DSST exams is awarded based upon the articulation of each individual exam. All CLEP and DSST exams are reviewed for major or general education requirements by university faculty. Credit for exams will be awarded based upon the articulation guidelines in effect at the time of a student\u2019s admission, not the date the test was originally completed. A combined maximum of 44 semester hours of credit by exam may be applied toward the bachelor\u2019s degree (AP and IB credits do not contribute to this total). Exams are normally articulated as lower division credit.<\/p>\n<h2>Exam Duplication Policy<\/h2>\n<p>A student is not eligible to earn credit by exam if that exam covers the same subject material that was covered in previously completed college level coursework. Furthermore, a student is not eligible to earn credit by exam if that exam covers material that is in the same general subject area as more advanced coursework that he or she previously completed. For example, if a student completed Calculus 1, he or she is not eligible to earn credit for a Pre-Calculus exam.<\/p>\n<h3>Examinations<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/38\/2024\/07\/AP-EXAMS-AY-2024-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Advanced Placement Exams (AP)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/38\/2018\/05\/College-Level-Examination-Program-exam-articulation-v161019.pdf\">College-Level Examination Program<\/a>\u00ae (CLEP)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/38\/2023\/12\/IB-Exams-Academic-Year-2023-24-V2.pdf\">International Baccalaureate<\/a> (IB)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/38\/2019\/02\/DSST-exam-chart-2.24.19.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DANTES Standardized Exams (DSST)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Students can take CLEP and\/or DSST (DANTES) exams to earn university credit.
