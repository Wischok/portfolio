He has also asked other friends to borrow money. He is spending an inordinate amount of time at the computer and appears to be overly invested in the outcomes of sporting events. What do you do?<\/p>\n<h2>Questions<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you know anyone who has a gambling problem? How do you know? What are\u2028the signs?<\/li>\n<li>How does it affect your relationship with this person?<\/li>\n<li>Who would you go to on your campus if you were concerned that a student-athlete may be gambling?<\/li>\n<li>Do you think it should be illegal for student-athletes to gamble as long as it\u2019s not on their sport?<\/li>\n<li>How could the competitive nature of being an athlete impact gambling behavior?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Considerations and Warning Signs<\/h2>\n<p>In 2004 the NCAA conducted a gambling behavior survey among 21,000 student-athletes attending more than 1,000 colleges and universities nationwide, representing more than 2,000 teams.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The NCAA study confirmed:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nearly 70% of male student-athletes reported gambling in the past year versus 47% among females.<\/li>\n<li>About 35% of males and 10% of females admitted to wagering on a sporting event in the past year, which is a direct violation of NCAA bylaws regarding sports wagering.<\/li>\n<li>20% of males and 5% of females bet on collegiate sporting events in the past year, even though if caught they would be banned from playing at an NCAA school for the rest of their lives.<\/li>\n<li>22% of male athletes and 6% of female student-athletes also admitted betting on football pools or with a bookie.<\/li>\n<li>Among Division I, II and III male student-athletes, 17% were classified as \u201cpotential problem gamblers or worse\u201d versus 3% among their female counterparts.<\/li>\n<li>Overall, less than 5% of males and one-half of 1% of females were categorized as problem or compulsive gamblers.<\/li>\n<li>Problem gamblers are also more likely to be in sexual relationships, have multiple sexual partners and engage in risky sexual behavior. They are also more commonly associated with consuming increased amounts of alcohol.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Stevin Smith was an all-Pac-12 Conference point guard from 1991-1994, twice leading his team to the NCAA tournament. However, he is best known for being a central figure in one of the worst point shaving scandals to hit college basketball in the last 50 years. During his senior season, Smith and a teammate took part in a conspiracy with fellow student and bookmaker Benny Silman to fix four games during the 1993-94 season, originally saying it was because of a gambling debt. Following the end of his prison term he publicly confessed they both had agreed to fix the games and had lied to escape a longer prison term. Silman received an extended 4-year sentence because of this (compared to Smith\u2019s 10 months).<\/p>\n<h3>Betting<\/h3>\n<p>Gambling includes betting on the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poker or other card games<\/li>\n<li>Dice, video or board games for money<\/li>\n<li>Car, horse or dog racing<\/li>\n<li>Lottery games<\/li>\n<li>Internet games using credit cards<\/li>\n<li>Slot or electronic poker machines<\/li>\n<li>Stock market<\/li>\n<li>Games of skill, like pool, golf, darts or bowling<\/li>\n<li>School, professional or fantasy sports<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Why do students gamble?<\/h3>\n<p>Students say they gamble because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chance to win money \u2014 think it\u2019s a fast and easy way to get rich quick<\/li>\n<li>Excitement of placing a bet<\/li>\n<li>To spend time with friends<\/li>\n<li>Distraction from everyday life<\/li>\n<li>To fit in or be accepted<\/li>\n<li>The rush of winning<\/li>\n<li>To feel important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Warning Signs<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive phone bills to 900 number services<\/li>\n<li>Obsession with point spreads<\/li>\n<li>Unusual interest in obscure games<\/li>\n<li>Makes excessive inquiries about the health status of athletes on a team<\/li>\n<li>Shifting allegiances \u2014 for\/against same team on different days<\/li>\n<li>Frequently asking friends or family for loans to get bailed out of desperate financial situations \u2014 debts, unpaid bills, other financial troubles<\/li>\n<li>Defensive when questioned about gambling behavior<\/li>\n<li>Chases losses<\/li>\n<li>Negative changes in attitude or behavior \u2014 irritable, restless, withdrawn, distracted<\/li>\n<li>Missing class, dropping grades, missing other commitments<\/li>\n<li>Separation from friends; jeopardizing significant relationships<\/li>\n<li>Selling personal belongings to get money<\/li>\n<li>Gambles as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving a negative mood or emotional pain (guilt, anxiety, helplessness, depression, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Has committed illegal acts such as forgery, fraud, or theft to finance gambling<\/li>\n<li>Reluctant to use \u201cgambling money\u201d for normal expenditures<\/li>\n<li>Receives gambling paraphernalia from Internet sports betting sites or possesses gambling related items such as lottery tickets, betting sheets, casino chips, or other souvenirs from gambling locations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Note:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0It is sometimes very difficult to notice when someone has a gambling problem \u2014 there aren\u2019t necessarily physical signs like in other examples.<\/p>\n<h3>Did you know\u2026?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gambling can be an addiction.
