Remind them that what feels beneficial at the time may have greater long-term costs. In other words, are the \u201crewards\u201d of the moment more valuable than the potential costs of the future (e.g., loss of scholarship; suspension\/expulsion; criminal record, etc.)? Also, consider how long the \u201crewards\u201d last vs. how long the \u201ccosts\u201d last. How long will your choice impact your life a day\/week\/month or year later? Considering possible costs and rewards over time can be eye opening.<\/p>\n<p>Help others by getting them to stop and think about what they are doing \u2014 or about to do. Is their decision aligned with their stated values? Will it jeopardize their future? Their goals? Their reputation? What they\u2019ve worked so hard for? What you\u2019ve ALL worked so hard for? Losing a teammate, even for a short period of time, may cost them (and you) in more ways than one. While it is important to support your teammates, it isn\u2019t always easy to know how to best do this. Blindly following actions and\/or not intervening in a situation you know in your gut to be wrong, is NOT supporting a teammate but rather assisting in their future troubles.<\/p>\n<p><em>Please see the\u00a0<a href=\"\/step-up\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2014\/07\/STEPUP_Worksheet_Scenario.pdf\">Scenario Worksheet<\/a>\u00a0in Appendix B for an example.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>The 5 Core Questions<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Please consider the following 5 Core Questions for situations in which you may need to intervene.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>More topic-specific questions are provided in the topics section of this website.
