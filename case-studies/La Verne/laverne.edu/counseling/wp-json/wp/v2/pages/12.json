So what exactly can you use a college counseling center for?<\/p>\n<p>You might be surprised at all the ways a college counseling center and staff can help make your college life easier! From stress management and mental health screenings to dealing with homesickness and relationship issues, a great counseling center can provide a ton of fabulous resources for you. Consider visiting your campus center if you need or want help with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Homesickness and adjustment issues<\/strong>. Starting college is a major life change. After all, when else do you leave your family and friends, start an entirely new academic program and structure, have to adjust to being on your own, are required to stay on top of your finances (not to mention do a million things with very limited funds), live in a tiny space with someone you\u2019ve never met before, and somehow keep your chin up? If you\u2019re homesick, having problems adjusting to college, or just want to process out everything you\u2019re adjusting to, stop in and see what resources are available to you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mental health treatment and maintenance<\/strong>. If you were seeing a therapist before you started college and\/or are taking prescription medication for a mental health issue, see if you can receive the same care from your college counseling center. Connecting with your campus center can be a great way to make sure your transition to college stays as smooth and healthy as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mental health issues that are common in college students (e.g., depression and anxiety)<\/strong>. If you find yourself struggling with some challenges \u2014 like possible depression or anxiety \u2014 that you didn\u2019t experience before you started college, make an appointment to talk to someone in the counseling center. Many of the therapists there will be specifically trained in dealing with issues that college students face \u2026 meaning they\u2019ll be a great resource from the moment you first connect with them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Difficulty dealing with any major life changes<\/strong>. Things might have been great when you started school. But since then, you may have experience some major, difficult life changes, like the death of someone close to you or the end of an important relationship. The therapists at your campus counseling center can help you through these changes so that your academics \u2014 and general enjoyment of your time in school \u2014 won\u2019t suffer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eating disorders and body image issues<\/strong>. Eating disorders and other similar or related health concerns are serious illnesses that require attention. If you\u2019re concerned about yourself or a friend, check with the counseling center to see what resources they provide. From support groups to individual counseling, you might be surprised at all the ways the staff make themselves available to struggling students.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Substance abuse issues<\/strong>. Nearly every college student knows at least one fellow student whose alcohol use gets a little out of hand. And just as many know someone whose drug use is clearly interfering with other aspects of their life in not-so-positive ways. If you\u2019re concerned about your own substance use (or abuse), give the center a call, send them an email, or even check online to see what resources are available to help.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stress management<\/strong>. Sadly, stress and college students go together as frequently as peanut butter and jelly. Sometimes, however, the amount of stress in a student\u2019s life can seem (and actually be) overwhelming. Whether you just want to talk to someone about all the stress you have or are looking for specific ways to help you deal with your stress a little better, the counseling center can help. You definitely won\u2019t be the first student who came in looking for help dealing with college stress!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Any other major issues<\/strong>. The ways a good college counseling center can help you are seemingly endless. If you have concerns that don\u2019t appear on this list, call or email your campus center to see if they can help you. Even if they can\u2019t, they likely can connect you with someone or somewhere close to campus who can.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Adapted from <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150906092230\/http:\/\/collegelife.about.com\/od\/healthwellness\/f\/What-Can-I-Use-The-College-Counseling-Center-For.htm\">What Can I Use the College Counseling Center for?<\/a>\u00a0by Kelci Lynn Lucier.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Call (909) 448-4105 or email\u00a0if you have questions or would like to make an appointment.
