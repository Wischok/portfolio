Your therapist will gather information about different areas of your life in the initial meeting; this process will help determine which treatment approach will be most helpful. You can then develop goals for counseling with your therapist.<\/p>\n<h3>Goal-Focused Model<\/h3>\n<p>CAPS provides individual therapy using a brief goal-focused therapy. During your first few sessions, your counselor will work with you to determine what your goals for therapy are and which goals are able to be accomplished in the given time frame. How long your therapy lasts depends on discussions with your therapist about specific concerns. If your goals require longer-term therapy than we can provide, you will be given referrals to appropriate off-campus resources.<\/p>\n<h2>Preparing for Individual Counseling<\/h2>\n<p>It is important to think about what you would like to gain from individual counseling. Writing down some events, relationships, and feelings before each session may help you think about what you want to do during each meeting. Be open with your therapist about how you would like to spend the time, and share any feelings that come up for you during the counseling process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Counseling and Psychology Services provides brief individual counseling.
