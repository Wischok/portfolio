However, seating for guests will be on a first-come, first-served basis, with overflow seating available in the Campus Center Ballrooms via live telecast.<\/p>\n<p>Formal sign-up will be done via the Commencement link. This link will be sent by the Commencement Office directly to all students who are cleared for graduation.<\/p>\n<p>Every student who wishes to participate is asked to submit a 200-character statement (approximately 30 words) with the following prompt: <strong>What do you want to express to those who have supported you in your academic journey?<\/strong> You can begin to think about this question before you register via the Commencement link that will be sent to you by the Commencement Office. This statement can be written in the language of preference or bilingually (keep the character count in mind).<\/p>\n<p>The registration deadline for the Spring 2024 Multicultural Graduation Celebration is\u00a0<strong>Thursday, April 25, 2024 at 5:00pm PST.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Graduation Sashes<\/h2>\n<p>The cultural graduation sashes can be\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bkstr.com\/lavernestore\/shop\/specialty-shops\/graduation\">purchased through the University of La\u00a0Verne Campus Store<\/a>.

Each celebration becomes a personalized experience for the student, their family, and friends. No tickets are required for entry.<\/p>\n<p>Students wishing to participate in Spring 2024 must be cleared for graduation. The Commencement Office will send the registration link to all who are cleared for graduation.<\/p>\n<p>For the multicultural graduation celebrations, students will wear their cap and gown, but not their academic hood.
