These experiences directly contribute to real-world job work skills, lifelong learning and wellness, ethical decision-making, and multicultural appreciation.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a sample of the ways students lead by example:<\/p>\n<h2>Associated Students of the University of La&nbsp;Verne (ASULV)<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-life\/asulv\/\">university\u2019s student government<\/a> provides an important opportunity for undergraduate students to gain leadership experience through campus governance, advocating for students\u2019 interests and rights, supporting clubs and organization, and serving as an official channel for students on campus. Elections are held each spring. Get to know the inner workings of ASULV by attending public meetings every Monday during the academic year at 3:00pm in the Campus Center.<\/p>\n<h2>Campus Activities Board (CAB)<\/h2>\n<p>One of the <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-life\/campus-activities-board\/\">most active groups on campus<\/a>, CAB coordinates a variety of programs and events annually. Consisting of nine committees focusing on different areas of interest, CAB constantly strives to develop new and innovative programs for the La&nbsp;Verne community. With three executive board positions and nine chairman positions, plus a variety of other duties, CAB provides a creative and active outlet to get involved in campus life.<\/p>\n<h2>Orientation Week Leader (OWL)<\/h2>\n<p>Ensure new students are welcomed to campus just as you were. OWLs help with student advising and registration (SOAR) dates during the summer and at New Student Orientation the week before school starts. You\u2019ll work with other Leos to put on fun events and make friendships along the way.<\/p>\n<h2>Greek Life<\/h2>\n<p>With two fraternities and four sororities on campus, students can take advantage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/student-life\/greek-life\/\">many leadership opportunities the Greek system offers<\/a>, from participating in chapter and committee positions to getting involved with the Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, College Panhellenic Association, or the Order of Omega.<\/p>\n<div class=\"youvisit-shortcode youvisit-embed-container\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px;\"><a alt=\"Launch Experience\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youvisit.com\/#\/vte\/?data-inst=60188&#038;data-platform=v&#038;data-remove-registration=1&#038;data-link-type=immersive&#038;data-image-quality=20&#038;data-image-height=100%&#038;data-image-width=100%&#038;data-hover-height=100%&#038;data-hover-width=100%&#038;data-ims-title=Explore+the+La%26nbsp%3BVerne+Campus&#038;data-ims-media-type=panorama\">Launch Experience<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne helps its students grow into leaders with many opportunities to step up and get involved.
