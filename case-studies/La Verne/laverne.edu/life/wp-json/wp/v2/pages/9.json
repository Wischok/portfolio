At the University of La&nbsp;Verne, we educate the whole student, so that you will have the skills to be a successful professional as well as a thoughtful citizen. And part of that well-rounded education includes health and wellness.<\/p>\n<h2>Intercollegiate Athletics<\/h2>\n<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne has a longstanding tradition of excellence in its intercollegiate athletics program. As a member of NCAA Division III\u2019s Southern California Intercollegiate Athletics Conference (SCIAC), the university may not offer sports scholarships, but we do offer the opportunity to play for the thrill, the competition, and the camaraderie of it all.<\/p>\n<p>Thirty percent of our undergraduate student body competes on our athletics teams, and our Leopard student-athletes are always students first. We believe competition depends not just on skill, but on character, preparation, and commitment. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.leopardathletics.com\/\">Explore our 18 athletic teams<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Randall Lewis Center for Well-Being and Research<\/h2>\n<p>If competitive athletics is not quite your thing, the Randall Lewis Center for Well-Being and Research offers programs to help improve your personal health and well-being. Opened in 2019, the center is home to exercise and training equipment, spaces for yoga and mental wellness activities, and a research space for health care-related academic majors and careers. <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/well-being\/\">Check out the latest schedule of Lewis Center programs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Other Fitness Facilities<\/h2>\n<p>All students can take advantage of our Moseley Strength &amp; Fitness Center, a weight room located in the Sports Science and Athletics Pavilion on the La&nbsp;Verne Campus. With 100 pieces of workout equipment, including a cardio area, free weights section, and numerous training spaces, students can exercise at their own pace, on their own schedule. Or you can take your workout outside with a run around the track at Ortmayer Stadium or a game of streetball on our outdoor basketball court in Leo Park.<\/p>\n<h2>Intramural Sports and Clubs<\/h2>\n<p><span>Are you up for a little friendly competition? Explore our intramural sports, which vary by the season but have included capture the flag, flag football, 3-on-3 basketball, soccer, softball and dodgeball in the past.
