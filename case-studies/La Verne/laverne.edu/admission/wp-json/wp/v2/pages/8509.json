This will allow plenty of time for you to receive an admission decision and take care of financial aid, class registration, and other enrollment tasks.<\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 32.9052%;\"><strong>Academic Term<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 67.0948%;\"><strong>Aim to Have Your Application Complete By<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 32.9052%;\">Fall Term (August and October starts)<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 67.0948%;\">June 1<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 32.9052%;\">Spring Term (January and April starts)<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 67.0948%;\">December 1<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 32.9052%;\">Summer Term (June start)<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 67.0948%;\">April 1<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>How to Apply<\/h2>\n<p>Apply to the University of La&nbsp;Verne through our application platform:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https:\/\/admissions.laverne.edu\/apply\/\">Start MY Application<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Application Requirements<\/h2>\n<p>To apply, complete the requirements below.
