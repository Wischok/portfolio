The pre-review is <strong>not<\/strong> considered part of the IRB review, but is a helpful step to\u00a0speed up the IRB review process and to help prevent your application from having to be reviewed by the college committee and the full board numerous\u00a0times (which is more time consuming than revisions during the pre-review process).<\/p>\n<h3>Limited Review and Expedited Review Applications<\/h3>\n<p>Expedited applications are reviewed by the college (referred to as &#8220;Area&#8221; in the policies and procedures documents) committee (Lead and Second Reviewers) and the Chair.<\/p>\n<h3>Standard Review Applications<\/h3>\n<p>Standard (full board) review applications (usually involving minors, pregnant women, prisoners, or other vulnerable populations, increased risk, etc.) require a vote from La&nbsp;Verne\u00a0IRB members at the monthly meeting and a longer review time. The college committee reviews the application after the pre-review to provide the applicant with the chance to revise their application in a manner that will help to eliminate additional\u00a0reviews by the full board at multiple meetings. If revisions are requested by the college committee, the revisions must be received 4 days prior to the full board meeting.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to clarify or revise your application after the full board has reviewed it, but before it is considered complete (this may be handled at the college level (and Chair) or the full board level). If the board stipulates they would like to review the revisions, your application will have to be reviewed at an additional monthly meeting.<\/p>\n<h3>Exempt Applications<\/h3>\n<p>Applications are reviewed by the Analyst and\/or the Chair. Once your application has advanced beyond pre-review, it will be reviewed <strong><em>one time<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0for an exempt determination. There are no chances to revise your application. You will either receive an exempt determination or your application will be rejected and it will be requested you apply for\u00a0Expedited or Standard Review. Thus, it is imperative you present a well-prepared application and the pre-review process will work hard to ensure this.<\/p>\n<h3>Not Human Subjects Research (NHSR)\u00a0Applications<\/h3>\n<p>NHSR applications are reviewed by IRBManager and the Analyst or Chair.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"lv_green\"><strong>Expectations of La&nbsp;Verne\u00a0IRB Review Timeline<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Consult the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/irb\/irb-monthly-committee-meetings\/\">meeting and operation schedule<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0and our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/irb\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/28\/2015\/02\/La-Verne-Turnaround-Time.pdf\">La&nbsp;Verne Turnaround Time<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0policy for turn around times.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most likely your application will require several sets of revisions at all stages of review (pre-review, exempt review, college, full board, Chair) in order to clarify content and address reviewer comments.
