Is the evidence a &#8220;suspicion&#8221; or (reasonably) &#8220;strong&#8221;? A suspicion should be investigated further but it would not rise to sanctionable or reportable.<\/p>\n<p>Example 1: Was the violation a &#8220;minor&#8221; citation error where the student forgot to cite a source in one area of an assignment but the rest of the paper was OK?<\/p>\n<p>Example 2: Was the violation a blatant violation of academic integrity where they copy\/pasted a whole paragraph from Wiki or generated an entire assignment using ChatGPT or a related artificial intelligence tool?<\/p>\n<p>If the evidence is (reasonably) &#8220;strong&#8221; or if the suspicion rises to probable (most likely than not) that the student violated an integrity principle, <span><em>the instructor should notify the student in writing and then meet with the student to discuss the concern (these are important steps in our policy)<\/em><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h5><span><em>Meeting with the Student<\/em><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The instructor should use this meeting to show the evidence to the student and to get an explanation (maybe even a confession*). The instructor should approach the meeting with an open-mind and as a teachable opportunity (also a key new part of our academic honesty policy) [do you want to be a Cop or an Educator?].<\/p>\n<p>According to the university policy on academic dishonesty, students &#8220;will have a chance for education.&#8221; Instructors should press the importance of academic honesty, what issues rose as concerning (show the evidence with specific examples and concerns), and how to avoid future incidents, including, possibly, a referral to Wilson Library to attend writing workshops that teach skills to avoid plagiarism.<\/p>\n<p>The meetings with students can also be helpful to the instructor to consider the students&#8217; reactions to the accusation(s) and the evidence, and allow for reasonable explanations from the student&#8217;s perspective before applying an academic sanction (if any).<\/p>\n<p><span><em>*If the student admits to the violation, consider this acceptance of responsibility when you apply the academic sanction that is proportional to the offense.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h5><span><em>Sanctioning the Violation(s)<\/em><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The instructor has a duty to educate their students and part of this ethos is to <em>fairly<\/em> sanction academic integrity violation(s). In the above examples, the instructor should fairly sanction the incident that is proportional to the offense. Do both examples above deserve an F on the course? For Example 1, probably not. For Example 2, maybe (keep reading below). If you are not sure about the appropriate academic penalty, consult with your department\/program chair.<\/p>\n<p>Let us continue with other examples and how each might be sanctioned differently:<\/p>\n<p><em>Example 1<\/em>: A student wrote an assignment on their own but forgot to cite a quote or a paraphrase on the assignment (but everything else was OK). The student might be given a warning (or word of caution) and an opportunity for resubmission (or not). The violation probably might not need to be <em>reported, or academically sanctioned<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Example 2<\/em>: A second incident in the course from the <em>same student<\/em> might rise to a more stern warning, a partial credit penalty, and reported to the department\/program chairperson and the University (using the Maxient form above).<\/p>\n<p><em>Example 3<\/em>: A different student produced an entire writing assignment using ChatGPT (or a related AI tool) and submitted it as their own. A case like this might warrant a more serious academic penalty such as a zero or F grade on the assignment and reported to the department\/program chairperson and the University (using the Maxient form above).<\/p>\n<p>Should the students in <em>Example 2\/3<\/em> earn an F in the course? It depends. Let&#8217;s say the student was under pressure with a deadline and things are not going well at home but confessed to &#8220;being desperate&#8221; or was careless in their citation work. The instructor might take this contrition (and admission of guilt) into consideration and lighten the academic penalty\u00a0 such as assigning an F\/Zero on the assignment and a warning that another incident would result in an F in the course. The instructor also informs the student they will report <em>this incident<\/em> to the department\/program chairperson and the University (using the Maxient form above).<\/p>\n<p>However, let&#8217;s say the student in <em>Example 2\/3<\/em> is combative, argumentative, and outright denying the accusation (despite the overall strength of the evidence), then the instructor might decide that a more severe academic penalty is warranted such as an F\/Zero on the assignment and an F in the course, and reported to the department\/program chairperson and the University (using the Maxient form above).<\/p>\n<h5>Reporting the Violation^<\/h5>\n<p>Do the examples above rise to a reportable offenses? It depends. Consult with your department chair if you are unsure if the violation is a &#8220;minor&#8221; violation that merits attention (a teachable moment about the importance of proper citations and how to do it), along with a &#8220;stern warning&#8221; to avoid another incident, whether an academic penalty is needed, and whether it should be reported to the University. Or the incident is so &#8220;blatant&#8221;&#8211;and the student is so &#8220;out of line&#8221; in their response to the accusation, despite the evidence&#8211;that it might deserve a more severe academic sanction and rises to a reportable incident. Full stop.<\/p>\n<p>You have every right to manage your course in ways that meet educational and professional standards, this includes broad discretion about whether an incident is reportable to the University. If you feel strongly that the incident should be reported then proceed to file the report (see Key Resources above for the link the reporting form).<\/p>\n<p><span><em>^If the student admits to the violation, accepts the instructor&#8217;s academic penalty, and rises as reportable, the instructor and the student should sign the &#8220;Instructor-Student Academic Integrity Resolution&#8221; form. The instructor should submit the form as an attachment to the Instructor&#8217;s Maxient reporting form (see the &#8220;Key Resources, Instructor Forms&#8221; above).<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h5><em>What Happens After a Report is Filed with the University?<\/em><\/h5>\n<p>When the instructor reports an incident of academic dishonesty, the Administrator will create a case file in Maxient and send a letter to the student with a formal notification of the accusation(s) and the academic penalty.<\/p>\n<p>The Administrator will also communicate with faculty administrators who have a need to know under FERPA (this includes, usually, the instructor, department\/program chairperson, college dean, provost, the VP of Enrollment Management, and the student&#8217;s academic advisor).<\/p>\n<p>The student has the right to appeal if they disagree with the accusation and\/or the academic penalty.
