By policy a final grade is based on the instructor\u2019s evaluation of course work completed as of the contractual end of the course. Final grades may not be changed as the result of the submission of additional work or the repeating of examinations after the contractual conclusion of the course for the purpose of improving the final grade. The Registrar is authorized to accept an adjusted grade only when all the following conditions are met:<\/p>\n<p>The student applies to the instructor for a reevaluation within four weeks after the student grade is available through MyLaVerne; The instructor concludes by re-evaluation that the original grade issued was in error; The revised grade is officially reported by the instructor to the Office of the Registrar as a result of re-evaluation within a reasonable time after the grade report was made available on MyLaVerne.<\/p>\n<p>A student may elect to repeat a University of La&nbsp;Verne course for the purpose of improving a grade only if repeated at La&nbsp;Verne. The student must enroll in the same La&nbsp;Verne course and is expected to repeat the course in its entirety. When a course is repeated, the original course, grade, and semester hours remain on the transcript, but are appropriately marked and are no longer part of the student\u2019s GPA or applicable toward credit for graduation. Only the grade and semester hours of the repeated course are counted.<\/p>\n<p>Notification of final grades for each course is made through each student\u2019s MyLaVerne account. A student who has a hold on his or her account must clear the hold to view final grades.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/catalog.laverne.edu\/academic-information\/#courseandgradeinformationtext\">Catalog<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content\" aria-label=\"Sent by Copilot: **Academic honesty** is of utmost importance at the **University of La&nbsp;Verne** (ULV). Here are some reasons why maintaining academic integrity matters at ULV: 1. **Maintaining Trust and Fairness**: Upholding academic honesty ensures that students, faculty, and the institution can trust one another. When everyone adheres to honesty, it creates a fair environment where achievements are recognized based on merit. 2. **Responsibility and Accountability**: ULV expects students to perform academic tasks with integrity. Unless an instructor explicitly defines what is permissible in academic conduct, students are generally expected to maintain honesty in all their courses[^2^]. 3. **Avoiding Plagiarism**: Plagiarism\u2014using someone else's wording, ideas, or findings without proper citation\u2014is strictly discouraged. ULV's policy on academic honesty emphasizes the importance of giving credit to original sources[^4^]. 4. **Academic Standing**: ULV has clear guidelines for academic standing: - **Good Standing (GS)**: Maintaining an overall GPA of 2.0 or higher keeps students in good standing. - **Academic Warning (AW)**: If a student fails to earn a term GPA of 2.0 or higher despite an overall GPA above 2.0, they receive an academic warning. - **Academic Probation (AP)**: Falling below a 2.0 GPA places students on academic probation. They must improve their GPA to continue. - **Academic Disqualification (AD)**: Failing to earn a 2.0 GPA after being on probation leads to academic disqualification. - **Academic Reinstatement**: Students may appeal for reinstatement after the first disqualification, but a second disqualification results in automatic dismissal for one academic year[^1^]. In summary, academic honesty at ULV ensures a respectful learning environment, encourages growth, and maintains the institution's reputation. &#x1f4da;&#x1f393;\">\n<div class=\"ac-container ac-adaptiveCard\">\n<div class=\"ac-textBlock\">\n<h3>APPEALING A FINAL GRADE<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Students wishing to appeal course grades should first contact the instructor of the course to appeal the grade. The appeal must be made within 4-weeks after the grades are issued. A successful appeal will require a Change of Grade form to be submitted by the instructor to the University Registrar in Woody Hall.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the student is dissatisfied with the appeal outcome with the instructor, they can appeal to the Department\/Program Chair and may continue the appeal to the Dean of the College (where the course resides) and ultimately to the Provost. Provost decisions are final.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you, the student, is considering an appeal, reflect on the following before proceeding:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the grounds for the appeal? (Mere disagreement with your grade does not constitute sufficient grounds for a grade appeal).<\/li>\n<li>What evidence supports these grounds?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Be prepared to write a personal statement (summarizing your argument(s).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ulv-gray-box\">\n<h2><span class=\"orange-bar\">Stages of Appeal<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"collapsible-content-1722983364622\" class=\"collapsible-content\">\n<p>Students who disagree with a final grade have the right to appeal. The student\u2019s intent to appeal triggers a <em>faculty-driven<\/em> appeal process:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Level I Appeal (Instructor)<\/strong>: the first step of an appeal is with the instructor to reconsider the final grade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Level II Appeal (Chairperson)<\/strong>: If the student disagrees with the instructor\u2019s decision to uphold the final grade, then they can appeal to the department\/program chair in the department where the course resides. The chairperson may meet with the student to review the evidence and decide whether to overturn the instructor\u2019s final grade or to uphold it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Level III Appeal (College Dean)<\/strong>: If the student disagrees with the chairperson\u2019s decision to uphold the instructor\u2019s final grade, then they can appeal to the college dean where the department resides. The chairperson may meet with the student to review the evidence and decide whether to overturn the instructor\u2019s original grade or uphold it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Level IV Appeal (Provost)<\/strong>: If the student disagrees with the college dean\u2019s decision to uphold the instructor\u2019s final grade, then they can appeal to the Provost. The Provost or their designee might decide directly or assemble a faculty judicial board that consists of at least three faculty from outside the college to review the final grade appeal. <em><strong>A Provost decision is in writing and is considered final<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>APPEAL FORM<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We recommend using this form to appeal a final grade. If you choose to not use the form, then the &#8220;old&#8221; way of appealing is by email, initiating the process with the instructor.
