Always consult with your academic advisor before taking a course in transfer.<\/p>\n<p>The University Registrar normally decides on general education or elective credits, but academic advisors will make decisions about major or minor credit(s) in transfer. A course that may qualify for major or minor credit should be accepted as an elective course at the very least by the Registrar to allow the academic advisor to use the course(s) for subject credit in the major or the minor. We strongly recommend that you also review the Registrar&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/\">Transfer &amp; Evaluation Center website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEMESTER UNITS VS QUARTER UNITS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before deciding on which college or university to transfer to, consider whether the institution operates on a semester-based or quarter-based system. The University of La&nbsp;Verne (ULV) is a semester-based university. If you transfer courses from another semester-based school, each transferable unit will be worth the same at ULV. For example, a course worth 3 semester hours at CSU Fullerton that is transferable will count for 3 semester hours at ULV.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you transfer from a quarter-based school, the value of the units will differ. A 3-quarter unit course from a quarter-based school will be worth less in semester hours at ULV. The University Registrar provides a useful conversion chart to help you determine how to convert quarter units to semester units, <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/transfer-credit-policies\/\">here<\/a>.*<\/p>\n<p>*The final decision is yours to make but you might probably want to attend a semester-based college or university.<\/p>\n<p><strong>COURSE TRANSFER OPTIONS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1) TAP (University of La&nbsp;Verne &#8211; Articulation Database)*^<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/advising\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/52\/2023\/10\/TAP-Navigation_ULV-Articulation-of-College-Courses_Fall-2023-LATER.pdf\">Navigate TAP<\/a> (PDF): Instructions to identify courses from across the United States that have been reviewed and articulated by the Office of the Registrar (these may include some &#8220;online&#8221; colleges listed below).<\/li>\n<li>View <em>TAP<\/em> within the La&nbsp;Verne <a href=\"https:\/\/myportal.laverne.edu\/\">Portal<\/a> &gt; Search Apps &gt; &#8220;TAP&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Q: What if the college I want to attend is not listed on the TAP database?<\/p>\n<p>A: <span>TAP lists courses only from colleges where students have previously transferred to ULV.

For example, if you enroll in Spanish I at Citrus Community College (Azusa, CA), you must also take Spanish II at Citrus Community College (or elsewhere) since only Spanish II will satisfy the our foreign language requirement. Spanish I from Citrus College will earn LVGE Humanities credit (LVHU) but will not earn the foreign language requirement.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Below are some resources for when the need arises to transfer a course to earn general education (GE) or major or minor subject or elective credit at the University of La&nbsp;Verne.
