ULV's policy on academic honesty emphasizes the importance of giving credit to original sources[^4^]. 4. **Academic Standing**: ULV has clear guidelines for academic standing: - **Good Standing (GS)**: Maintaining an overall GPA of 2.0 or higher keeps students in good standing. - **Academic Warning (AW)**: If a student fails to earn a term GPA of 2.0 or higher despite an overall GPA above 2.0, they receive an academic warning. - **Academic Probation (AP)**: Falling below a 2.0 GPA places students on academic probation. They must improve their GPA to continue. - **Academic Disqualification (AD)**: Failing to earn a 2.0 GPA after being on probation leads to academic disqualification. - **Academic Reinstatement**: Students may appeal for reinstatement after the first disqualification, but a second disqualification results in automatic dismissal for one academic year[^1^].
