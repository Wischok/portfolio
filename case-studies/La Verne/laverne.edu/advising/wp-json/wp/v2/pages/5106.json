With so many choices, the process of selecting a single major, let alone a double major, or a minor could be overwhelming. If you are undeclared or are reconsidering your chosen major, you are not alone!<\/p>\n<p>Being undeclared about a college major is not unusual; approximately 20 percent of students are admitted as undeclared. Nor is it unusual for students who have chosen a major to change their minds at least once. There are many other students who are going through the same process. \u00a0A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/campustechnology.com\/articles\/2016\/08\/25\/study-switching-majors-increases-graduation-rates.aspx\">study<\/a> suggests that 75-85% of student switch majors increasing their chances of graduating on time.

With the right guidance and resources that are available to you at the University of La&nbsp;Verne, deciding on a major should not be an anxiety-filled process.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to select a major wisely and to think about the timing of making a decision because timely graduation (within 4 years) becomes more difficult the more you delay in choosing a major and completing the subject requirements.
