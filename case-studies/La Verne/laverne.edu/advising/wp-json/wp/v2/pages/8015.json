Here are some reasons why maintaining academic integrity matters at ULV: 1. **Maintaining Trust and Fairness**: Upholding academic honesty ensures that students, faculty, and the institution can trust one another. When everyone adheres to honesty, it creates a fair environment where achievements are recognized based on merit. 2. **Responsibility and Accountability**: ULV expects students to perform academic tasks with integrity. Unless an instructor explicitly defines what is permissible in academic conduct, students are generally expected to maintain honesty in all their courses[^2^]. 3. **Avoiding Plagiarism**: Plagiarism\u2014using someone else's wording, ideas, or findings without proper citation\u2014is strictly discouraged. ULV's policy on academic honesty emphasizes the importance of giving credit to original sources[^4^]. 4. **Academic Standing**: ULV has clear guidelines for academic standing: - **Good Standing (GS)**: Maintaining an overall GPA of 2.0 or higher keeps students in good standing. - **Academic Warning (AW)**: If a student fails to earn a term GPA of 2.0 or higher despite an overall GPA above 2.0, they receive an academic warning. - **Academic Probation (AP)**: Falling below a 2.0 GPA places students on academic probation. They must improve their GPA to continue. - **Academic Disqualification (AD)**: Failing to earn a 2.0 GPA after being on probation leads to academic disqualification. - **Academic Reinstatement**: Students may appeal for reinstatement after the first disqualification, but a second disqualification results in automatic dismissal for one academic year[^1^]. In summary, academic honesty at ULV ensures a respectful learning environment, encourages growth, and maintains the institution's reputation. &#x1f4da;&#x1f393;\">\n<div class=\"ac-container ac-adaptiveCard\">\n<div class=\"ac-textBlock\">\n<h3>Initial Intervention(s)<\/h3>\n<p><strong>The instructor is strongly encouraged to notify the student privately and firmly that the behavior is concerning.
