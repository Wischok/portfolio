However, full-time enrollment is met when students complete at least 24 semester hours per year while maintaining a 2.0 cumulative GPA; a part-time student, when completing 12 semester hours per year while maintaining a 2.0 cumulative GPA.<\/p>\n<p>Student class level is determined by the number of semester hours completed as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>0-27, freshman;<\/li>\n<li>28-59, sophomore;<\/li>\n<li>60-91, junior;<\/li>\n<li>92 and above, senior.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Students must meet the satisfactory academic progress standards as described under Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in the Financial Aid section of the University <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/catalog\/\">catalog<\/a> to maintain financial aid eligibility.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: <span>The information on this page is for general guidance and may not apply to your specific situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"ulv-gray-box\">\n<h2><span class=\"orange-bar\">Legend<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Good Standing (GS):\u00a0<\/strong>If you maintain an overall GPA of 2.0 or higher then you&#8217;re in good standing.\u00a0 [Note: A grade of C- is not equivalent to a 2.0 GPA].<\/li>\n<li><strong>Academic Warning (AW):<\/strong> If you fail to earn a term GPA of 2.0 or higher even though your overall GPA is above 2.0, then you will be given an academic warning. The academic warning is posted on the transcript and grade report for that semester.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Academic Probabtion (AP):<\/strong> If your overall GPA falls below 2.0 then you will be placed on academic probation.\u00a0 If you were academically reinstated after academic disqualification, you will be placed back on academic probation.\u00a0 A notation will be made on the transcript. Academic probation is a serious warning that your academic record is unsatisfactory.If you are on academic probation, you must obtain a ULV GPA of 2.0 or above each academic term until the cumulative ULV GPA meets or exceeds 2.0.\u00a0 You will not be eligible to enroll in the culminating activity or be cleared for Commencement until academic probation is removed.If you fail to improve your academic standing after one semester will be academically disqualified.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Academic Disqualification (AD):<\/strong> If you fail to earn a ULV GPA of 2.0 in any semester after being placed on academic probation, you\u00a0 will be academically disqualified.\u00a0 Academic disqualification will be recorded on the transcript.If you are disqualified for the first time, you may appeal for reinstatement and resume an academic probation status.\u00a0 You must maintain a ULV GPA of 2.0 or better every academic term until you resume good standing (an overall GPA of 2.0 or higher).\u00a0 If you are disqualified a second time&#8211;failed to earn a ULV GPA of 2.0 or higher in any academic term&#8211;then you must leave ULV for one academic year to take courses elsewhere and prove that you can be successful before returning to ULV by appeal reinstatement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Academic Reinstatement or Readmission<\/h3>\n<p>The Dean of Academic &amp; Career Success may consider extenuating circumstances in your appeal for reinstatement after receiving a notice of academic disqualification (first disqualification).\u00a0 A second disqualification for failing to earn a ULV GPA of 2.0 or higher results in automatic dismissal for one academic year.<\/p>\n<p>During your absence after disqualification, you are encouraged to matriculate in courses at another college or university to demonstrate academic success.\u00a0 You can use these courses to appeal for academic reinstatement after one academic year.\u00a0 We encourage enrollment in degree bearing courses that can be transferred to ULV.<\/p>\n<h3>Financial Aid Implications<\/h3>\n<p>Because financial aid is not guaranteed and may be denied even if you are academically reinstated, you may need to consider a financial plan on how you intend to pay tuition in the absence of financial aid.\u00a0 Academic reinstatement and financial aid by appeal are not guaranteed, thus, you are\u00a0 expected to treat these appeals as serious matters.<\/p>\n<h3>Course Overloads, Financial Aid, and Billing<\/h3>\n<p>A traditional undergraduate at the Central Campus must petition to the Undergraduate Appeals Committee if he\/she wishes to enroll for a total of more than 18 semester hours at La&nbsp;Verne or concurrently at another college or university.\u00a0 Seeking pre-approval of the transfer course(s) may save you valuable time and money if a course is determined as not ligible for transfer.\u00a0 The Registrar&#8217;s Transfer Center has more information about transferring courses, <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/evaluation\/\">HERE<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Course overloads for January Inter-term and\/or retroactive appeals for course overloads are not permitted.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/registrar\/\">Registrar<\/a> handles academic appeals.<\/p>\n<h3>Enrollment of Traditional Undergraduates in Fall\/Spring Term, Regional and Online Campuses<\/h3>\n<p>Starting in fall term 2021, traditional undergraduates may register for any course(s) up to 18-semester hours attempted in fall or spring terms (17-week semester or 8-week session 1 or 8-week session 2) from any ULV campus <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/locations\/\">location<\/a>, except at the military campuses or work-site locations.\u00a0 Faculty recommend, but do not require, that traditional undergraduates not exceed 10 semester hours in any one session in either fall or spring terms.<\/p>\n<p>Be mindful about how your overall enrollment may affect financial aid or tuition, see the &#8220;Course Overloads, Financial Aid, and Billing&#8221; section on this page for details.<\/p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/academics\/calendars\/realignment\/\">HERE<\/a> for more information about our new academic calendar.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Full-time traditional undergraduates are encouraged to enroll in at least 32 semester hours each academic year to graduate within 4 years.
