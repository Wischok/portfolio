It is important that you are aware and plan accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>Receiving Aid at More than One College or University<\/h3>\n<p>You may not receive Federal financial aid from more than one school during the same period of enrollment or when enrollment periods overlap.<\/p>\n<h3>Federal Pell Grant<\/h3>\n<p>The amount of <cite title=\"A federal grant for undergraduate students with financial need.\">Federal Pell Grant<\/cite> funds you may receive over your lifetime is limited by federal law to be the equivalent of six years (12 full-time semesters) of Pell Grant funding.<\/p>\n<p>If your Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) equals or exceeds six years (12 full-time semesters), you may no longer receive Pell Grant funding. Similarly, if your LEU is greater than five years\u00a0 but less than six years, your eligibility for Pell the next year will be prorated.<\/p>\n<p>You can log on to National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS\u00a0) to view your lifetime Pell Grant eligibility used.<\/p>\n<h3>Federal Subsidized Direct Loan<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a first-time borrower on or after July 1, 2013, there is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. You may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are enrolled in a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree program, the maximum period for which you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans is six years (150 percent of 4 years = 6 years). Because your maximum eligibility period is based on the length of your current program of study, your maximum eligibility period can change if you change to a program that has a different length. Also, if you receive Direct Subsidized Loans for one program and then change to another program, the Direct Subsidized Loans you received for the earlier program will generally count toward your new maximum eligibility period.<\/p>\n<h3>Federal Direct Subsidized and Subsidized Yearly and Lifetime Student Loan Limits<\/h3>\n<p>Federal Direct student loans are limited in the amount you can borrow each year and in aggregate over your lifetime.\u00a0 The U.S. Dept of Ed publishes those limits <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.gov\/understand-aid\/types\/loans\/subsidized-unsubsidized#how-much-can-i-borrow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Federal Work-Study (FWS)<\/h3>\n<p>Students with federal work-study are limited to working a maximum of 20 hours per week, and earnings are limited to the amount awarded in your financial aid package. FWS can be earned from the first day of classes in the fall to the last day of finals in the spring. It is not available for summer employment, nor can it be earned any semester\/term the student is not enrolled full time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Financial aid programs have eligibility limits after which students are no longer eligible to receive funding.
