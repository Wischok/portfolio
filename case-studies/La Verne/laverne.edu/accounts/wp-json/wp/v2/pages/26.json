Eligibility requirements include, but may not be limited to the following; registered for classes, maintaining satisfactory academic progress, enrolled in the correct number of units and satisfying and completing necessary documentation. Financial aid programs are subject to federal, state, institutional, and lenders funding levels. Forms, dates and requirements are subject to change.<\/p>\n<h3>Notice of Disbursement and Right to Cancel Federal Loans<\/h3>\n<p>As a student or parent borrower, you have the right to cancel the entire loan or any portion (a specific disbursement) of any federal Stafford, Perkins or PLUS loan. Requests to cancel a specific loan disbursement may be submitted prior to the date of crediting to your account or within 14 days from the date you receive official notification from the Student Accounts Office that loan funds have credited to your account. To request cancellation of a loan disbursement, please complete a\u00a0Request to Return and Cancel Loans Form. No interest will be charged and loan fees will be returned to the loan holder.<\/p>\n<p><span>If a borrower wishes to cancel all or part of a loan disbursement after the 14 day window has elapsed, they should contact their loan servicer for instructions. Funds returned by a borrower more than 120 days after disbursement will be accepted by the servicer as payment rather than cancellation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cancelling your loan disbursement could cause a balance to be due on your student account which you will be responsible for paying. This is especially true if you have received a bookstore voucher or a refund due to excess funds (credit balance) on your account.<\/p>\n<h3>Repayment AFTER the Designated Time Period<\/h3>\n<p>You cannot cancel your loan disbursement if the designated time period described above has already passed. Instead, you can repay the loan disbursement directly by contacting the loan holder (<a href=\"https:\/\/fsapartners.ed.gov\/help-center\/fsa-customer-service-center\/loan-servicing-centers-for-schools?lsc=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Direct Loan Servicer<\/a>\u00a0for Federal Direct Loans or the Student Loan Specialist at the University of La\u00a0Verne for Perkins Loan). The borrower (you for student loans; the parent borrower for parent loans) will be responsible for any interest that may have accrued and\/or any loan fees.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Disbursement is when funds are disbursed or credited to a student&#8217;s account at the University of La\u00a0Verne.
