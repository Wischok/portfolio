Failure to attend class or informing the instructor does not constitute official withdrawal from a course. Failure to complete the withdrawal process by the established deadline dates will result in a continued obligation for tuition and other charges. Students who have received (or whose accounts have been credited with) financial aid funds will have these funds returned to the appropriate financial aid programs before any refunds will be issued to the student.<\/p>\n<p>Policies and procedures on withdrawal are covered in the \u201cTuition Credits\/Refunds\u201d section below as well as in the sections entitled \u201cWithdrawal from La\u00a0Verne by Financial Aid Recipients\u201d and \u201cWithdrawal from the University\u201d in the catalog.<\/p>\n<h3>Room and Board Refunds<\/h3>\n<p>Refunds for the residence halls will be made according to the terms and conditions outlined on the Residence Hall License Agreement. The amount of refund will be determined by the Housing Office. Board refunds during the Fall, Winter, and Spring terms\/semesters will be calculated on a prorated basis. There will be no refunds for January Interterm.<\/p>\n<h3>Tuition Credits\/Refunds<\/h3>\n<p>To be eligible for tuition credit(s), a student must complete an, online drop, or online withdrawal of their class(es) before the tuition credit deadline for the semester or term. The date of withdrawal for purposes of tuition credit shall be the date on which the \u00a0student withdraws or drops. Students who need assistance with the online drop or withdrawal process should contact the Office of the Registrar or their Regional Campus. If eligible, a refund will be generated within 14 days of the date your student account reflects a credit status. Checks are mailed to your mailing address.<\/p>\n<h3>Tuition Refund\/Credit Policy<\/h3>\n<p>Students who drop their class(es) through the end of the add\/drop period are eligible for 100% refund of tuition and fees. \u00a0Student who withdraw from class(es) seven business day from the end of the add\/drop period are eligible for 75% refund of tuition charged. \u00a0Students who withdraw from their class(es) seven business days from the end of the 75% refund period are eligible for 50% refund of tuition charged. \u00a0Courses that are less than seven weeks are not eligible for a 50% refund. The tuition refund policies for dismissal and suspension are the same as for voluntary withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>Students who receive federal financial aid are subject to a pro-rata return of federal funds through the 60% period of each term or semester, as described in the Withdrawal from the La&nbsp;Verne by Financial Aid Recipients section of the catalog. The 60% period is calculated by dividing the number of days enrolled in the term by the total number of days within the term. The amount of funds that must be returned is determined by dividing the number of days in the term or semester that the student was not enrolled by the total number of days in the term or semester. The Financial Aid Office will calculate the amount of the refund to the financial aid programs.<\/p>\n<p>If a student drops classes after the tuition credit period, but before the 60% period of a term, the student will be charged for the entire amount of tuition, but a prorated portion of the financial aid will be returned to the Title IV Program.<\/p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 17.35pt;margin: 0in 0in 8.0pt 0in\">Petitions to the stated policy, for medical reasons or reasons beyond the control of the students, should be in writing and addressed to the Executive Director of Student Financial Services. Any exceptions to the policy must also be approved by the Chief Financial Officer.<\/p>\n<h3>Student Refunds<\/h3>\n<p><strong>If eligible, a refund check or direct Deposit will be generated within 14 days of the date your student account goes into credit status. <\/strong>Checks are mailed to your mailing address. A student who is eligible for a refund due to excess financial aid and who uses a credit card to pay any and all of his or her tuition and fees will have a refund processed to his or her credit card up to the amount of the payment. \u00a0This policy applies to all credit card transactions, regardless of the order of payment. \u00a0Any credit over the amount paid by credit card will be processed through direct deposit or paper check. For students who are eligible for Financial Aid and Veteran Affair benefits, a refund will only be issued after the funds have been received from both entities and the account goes into a credit status.<\/p>\n<h3>VA Vocational Rehabilitation Refund Policy<\/h3>\n<p>Student refunds are available if you have a credit balance after your financial aid and Veteran Benefits have been applied to your student account.<\/p>\n<p>Veterans receiving Vocational Rehabilitation benefits (Chapter 31) Undergraduate Veterans utilizing VRE benefits (Chapter 31) who will also receive a Pell Grant, may be eligible to apply for an advance on the credit expected to remain after tuition and fees are paid by the VA, up to $2,500.\u00a0 Additional information and instructions are located here <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/accounts\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/66\/2019\/05\/VA-Voc-Rehab-Policy-0513191.pdf\">VA Vocational Rehabilitation Refund Policy and Form.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Military Tuition Assistance (TA) Refund Policy<\/h3>\n<p>The Department of Defense memorandum of understanding requires that the university \u201chave an institutional policy that returns any unearned Tuition Assistance (TA) funds on a proportional basis through at least the 60 percent portion of the period for which the funds were provided. TA funds are earned proportionally during an enrollment period, with unearned funds returned based upon when a student stops attending.\u201d In accordance with that requirement, the university TA funds return policy is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>Schedule:<br \/>\n8- Week Course: withdrawal submitted<br \/>\nDay 1-5 100 % return<br \/>\nDay 6-12 75% return<br \/>\nDay 13-19 50% return<br \/>\nDay 20-34 40% return (60% of course is completed)<br \/>\nDay 35+ 0% return<\/p>\n<p>10- Week Course: withdrawal submitted<br \/>\nDay 1-9 100 % return (If includes holiday add one additional day)<br \/>\nDay 10-16 75% return<br \/>\nDay 17-23 50% return<br \/>\nDay 24-37 40% return (60% of course is completed)<br \/>\nDay 38+ 0% return<\/p>\n<p>16-Week Course: withdrawal submitted<br \/>\nDay 1-9 100 % return (If includes holiday add one additional day)<br \/>\nDay 10-16 75% return<br \/>\nDay 17-23 50% return<br \/>\nDay 24-37 40% return (60% of course is completed)<br \/>\nDay 38+ 0% return<\/p>\n<p>For courses that have duration&#8217;s differing from those listed above:<br \/>\nUnearned TA funds will be returned on a prorated basis, depending on the length of the course. To determine the amount of TA that needs to be returned, the institution will determine the date the withdrawal was submitted, and then divide that by the number of days in the term to determine the percentage of TA that was earned by the student.<\/p>\n<p>Example: The student enrolled in a course that&#8217;s duration is 30 days. The withdrawal was submitted on the 14th day. The institution would perform the calculation to determine how much TA was earned by the student&#8217;s attendance: (14 divided by 30 equals 46.6%. 47% of the TA authorized was earned by the student, which means 53% of what was authorized will be returned to the DOD)<\/p>\n<h3>Delinquent Payment of Tuition<\/h3>\n<p>La&nbsp;Verne reserves the right to refuse a diploma or a transcript to any student or former student who is delinquent in the payment of any financial agreement note given in payment of any tuition, costs, or fees. \u00a0Financial holds are placed on the transcripts of students with delinquent accounts, and no transcripts or diplomas will be issued for such students until the holds have been removed. Students who have not met their financial obligations at the beginning or completion of a semester of enrollment may be withdrawn automatically from all courses in that semester\/term.<\/p>\n<p>The University reserves the right to request prepayment before allowing registration from students who do not comply with the payment policies or whose accounts have previously been subject to collections.<\/p>\n<p>Unpaid balances at the end of each semester may become interest bearing at the rate of 10% per annum. Interest on the outstanding balance may be computed and added monthly to the amount due. \u00a0However, if the balance is outstanding for more than 180 days, the interest rate may escalate to 15% per annum.<\/p>\n<p>If it becomes necessary for the University to seek collection help and\/or initiate legal proceedings to collect unpaid accounts, the student may be responsible for all legal fees incurred.<\/p>\n<h3>VA Pending Payment Compliance Policy<\/h3>\n<p>In accordance with Title 38 US Code 3679 subsection (e), this school adopts the following additional provisions for any students using U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Post 9\/11 G.I. Bill\u00ae (Ch. 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation &amp; Employment (Ch. 31) benefits, while payment to the institution is pending from the VA. This school will not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent the student&#8217;s enrollment<\/li>\n<li>Assess a late penalty fee to the student<\/li>\n<li>Require the student to secure alternative or additional funding (if covered 100% by VA funding)<\/li>\n<li>Deny the student access to any resources (access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities) available to other students who have satisfied their tuition and fee bills to the institution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, to qualify for this provision, such students are required to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Produce the VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) or 1905 by the first day of class.<\/li>\n<li>Complete the electronic <a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/veterans\/va-benefits-certification\/\">VA Benefits Certification Form<\/a> or submit a written request.<\/li>\n<li>Provide additional information needed to properly certify the enrollment as described in other institutional policies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is the student\u2019s responsibility to officially withdraw online or notify the Registrar, or the regional campus where the student is enrolled, if he or she is unable to process the online withdrawal from classes at any point during the semester or term.
