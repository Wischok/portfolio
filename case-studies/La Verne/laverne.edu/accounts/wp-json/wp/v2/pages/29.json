All refund checks are mailed to the mailing address on file. If you have set an account up for Direct Deposit, you should receive the refund in your account within 7-10 business days from the time your Student Account goes into credit status. A student who is eligible for a refund due to excess financial aid and who used a credit card to pay any and all of his or her tuition and fees will have a refund processed to his or her credit card up to the amount of the payment. This policy applies to all credit card transactions, regardless of the order of payment. Any credit over the amount paid by credit card will be processed through direct deposit or paper check.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What if I fail to make financial arrangements one month before the start of the term or semester?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If financial arrangements are not made one month before the first day of classes for semester based programs or one week before the first day of classes for term based programs, the student will be assessed a Late Financial Arrangement Fee of $100. This fee will be reflected in your My Student Account Center.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How do I set up a payment plan if I am reimbursed by my employer?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Students who are reimbursed by their employer are eligible for a payment plan where a 25% down payment is required plus the deferment fee. The remainder of the balance is due 45 days after the class ends. To participate in this plan, students must submit a\u00a0<span><a href=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/accounts\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/66\/2020\/03\/Company-Reimbursement-Form-1.pdf\">Company Reimbursement Form<\/a>\u00a0<\/span>each academic year. This form must be completed by the student and their employer and submitted to Student Accounts. Once the form is received, then the student can log into MyLaVerne and sign up for a Company Reimbursed Payment Plan.<\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What is a Financial Responsibility Agreement?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The Financial Responsibility Agreement is a financial commitment from the student to pay tuition and fee charges associated with enrollment, in exchange for the education and other benefits provided by the University of La&nbsp;Verne.\u00a0 The agreement outlines the university\u2019s guidelines and procedures for payment, holds, the employment of collection agencies, contact methods and procedures as well as tax document delivery methods.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em><b>How often do I need to sign the agreement?<\/b>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">All students are required to accept the University of La&nbsp;Verne Financial Responsibility Agreement prior to registration.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">To ensure that you are considering your finances each semester, the agreement must be signed twice a year during registration for Summer\/Fall and Spring\/Jan Term.\u00a0 Additional enrollment for the same semester will not require another signed agreement.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em><b>What happens if I refuse to sign?<\/b>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If the student does not accept the agreement, then they will not be able to register for classes.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">The agreement serves as notification of potential consequences of non-payment, and to provide vital account information.\u00a0 If a student chooses not to sign the agreement, they will not be permitted to register for classes until the issue is resolved.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em><b>How quickly can I register after completing the agreement?<\/b>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Completion of the agreement will remove the action item immediately and you will be able to proceed with enrollment.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For questions about student account charges and balance information, contact the Office of Student Accounts at\u00a0(909) 448-4060.
