You can request a food bag any time to pick up during our monthly distribution. We offer four types of food bags: Regular, Vegetarian, Kosher, and Halal. Each bag has nonperishable foods, and fresh produce may be available throughout the year thanks to donations from the community.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the food in your bag might need a can opener, stove, or microwave to prepare. Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t have these at home! You can grab a can opener from the Leo Food Pantry, or use the ones available at Barb&#8217;s Place, Citrus Residence Hall Kitchenette, Vista Residence Hall Lounge, or the Randall Lewis Center.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https:\/\/forms.office.com\/r\/JBn9hBVBEw\">Request a Food Bag<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The food pantry will be distributing food bags during the following dates during the 2024-2025 academic year:<\/p>\n<p>September 9-13, 2024<\/p>\n<p>October 7-11, 2024<\/p>\n<p>November 12-15, 2024<\/p>\n<p>December 9-13, 2024<\/p>\n<p>January 13-17, 2025<\/p>\n<p>February 10-14, 2025<\/p>\n<p>March 24-28, 2025<\/p>\n<p>April 21-25, 2025<\/p>\n<p>May 26-30, 2025<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Meal Voucher Form<\/h2>\n<p>CARE Network members should complete the <a href=\"https:\/\/forms.office.com\/r\/mJziLbEc14\">Meal Voucher Form<\/a> when distributing to students.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know that many college students struggle with having enough food to eat?
