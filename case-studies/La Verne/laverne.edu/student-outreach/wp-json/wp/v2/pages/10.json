We not only hear about their academic successes and challenges, but we see them when they come home. We learn about their families, social groups, mental health, relationships, and passions.

Every day, I create time for fun. For me, fun looks like exercising, playing games or sports with friends, and listening to music. Each week I have a night designated to quiet, reflective practices to help process what I went through and how I am feeling. I journal at home, take myself to dinner (no phone), or go for a drive and sit at the beach. As needed, I leave campus to get out of what can be a stressful environment. I go for walks, bike rides, and visit friends and family.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ulv-gray-box\">\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/directory\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2019\/12\/Esveiri-Conchas-Garcia-200x200.jpg\" alt=\"Esveiri Conchas Garcia\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><span class=\"orange-bar\">Esveiri Conchas Garcia<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Coord, Residence Life<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why I am a part of the CARE Network:<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>How I take care of my well-being:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The CARE Network is here is help students thrive emotionally, physically, and socially, and to support academic success.
