I found myself this summer. I had the opportunity to bike everywhere and enjoy the richness of nature. I loved the sight of fireflies, the dark sky, the smell of fresh air, the delicious fruits I picked with my own hands. I had time to think and talk to people about my faith and to explore it more deeply. I had the opportunity to do things I never imagined doing in my life, like milking a cow, eating out of compost, talking with people I would usually stay away from. I had been missing out, and I can say that I am a better version of myself because of this experience.\u201d &#8211; Jacqueline Perez-Valencia, New Community Project, VA<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to participate in Summer Service!\u00a0 I was able to make close friends, grow as a person, and make a positive difference.&#8221; &#8211; Euridicy Rodriguez, Camp Koinonia, WA<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-2447\" title=\"Students baking cookies\" src=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/chaplain\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/41\/2014\/11\/20140629_133837-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Students baking cookies\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/laverne.edu\/chaplain\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/41\/2014\/11\/20140629_133837-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/laverne.edu\/chaplain\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/41\/2014\/11\/20140629_133837-744x992.jpg 744w, https:\/\/laverne.edu\/chaplain\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/41\/2014\/11\/20140629_133837-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/laverne.edu\/chaplain\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/41\/2014\/11\/20140629_133837-900x1200.jpg 900w, https:\/\/laverne.edu\/chaplain\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/41\/2014\/11\/20140629_133837-576x768.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>&#8220;Once in a lifetime experience!\u00a0 Take this opportunity to look at a different perspective and grow as a person. &#8211; Mark Julius Batacan, Camp Myrtlewood, OR<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I have not only received an education about grass roots organizing, but also about how to better communities.&#8221;\u00a0 &#8211; Abril Camarena, Dolores Huerta Foundation, CA<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know who you truly are until you are faced with struggle, uncomfortableness, and conflict.\u00a0 The experiences you allow to happen in your life will be the only experiences that will transform you.&#8221; Yelsse Bahena, New Community Project, VA<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Once in a lifetime opportunity to immerse myself in a difference faith and way of thinking.&#8221; &#8211; Ruby Romero, Baha&#8217;i Community, Rancho Cucamonga<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"callout\"><em>\u201cWhat I see most often is that students return from their Summer Service experience changed.
