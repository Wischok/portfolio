It is only natural that we would seek to participate in a challenge that would allow us to take more active steps towards implementing sustainable solutions on our campus.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>During the next six years, La&nbsp;Verne will work to build its fund, which could be used for such things as replacing traditional light bulbs around campus with energy-saving LED fixtures. Under the plan, all money saved by such measures goes back into the fund to be used for additional projects that will save additional energy and operating costs. These \u201crevolving\u201d funds remain dedicated to green projects, where the savings realized from such measures are reinvested into the account.<\/p>\n<p>There are additional benefits suggested by <a href=\"http:\/\/greenbillion.org\">greenbillion.org<\/a>, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Institutionalizing a mechanism for funding efficiency.\u00a0<\/strong>Green revolving funds provide perpetual resources, even if budgets tighten and funding becomes more scarce in the future. A dedicated fund, rather than a series of one-off investments, provides a formal and more secure commitment that ensures cost-saving efficiency projects will be funded.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Streamlining the internal loan process. <\/strong>It is often easier for facilities staff to access a dedicated fund for financing projects than to navigate a more complex funding structure each time they want to acquire capital from the university.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Implementing performance tracking<\/strong>. A revolving fund helps guide the measuring of cost savings and energy data, which can then be used to benchmark against the performance of peer institutions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instilling sustainability as an institutional value.<\/strong> All members of the campus community interact with a green revolving fund, whether through student research, implementing facilities projects, financial tracking, or Board and administration leadership on sustainability. Green measures are also very marketable, and provide tangible evidence that demonstrates a commitment to sustainability in ways that one-time allocations do not.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cEstablishing a Green Revolving Fund ensures that the university is always able to continue its commitment to sustainability,\u201d Houston-Brown said. \u201cThe fund will allow us to implement projects that will reduce our carbon footprint and ensure we are efficient and judicious in our energy use. It will also provide us with the opportunity to develop living laboratories whereby our students can be exposed to hands-on sustainability efforts and projects in addition to the intellectual exposure to such issues in the classroom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thirty-nine other schools feel the same way and have backed it up with $72 million, so far.\u00a0 Along with them, La&nbsp;Verne leads a new movement to reduce the environmental impact of industry, even one light bulb or one plastic bottle at a time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of La&nbsp;Verne has become the second seat of higher education in California to join the Billion Dollar Green Challenge \u2014 for no other reason than it\u2019s the right thing to do.
